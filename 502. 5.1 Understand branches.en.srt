1
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,609
Before we discuss branches, let's
first talk about our commit process.

2
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:13,259
So when we are creating commits,

3
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,379
what we are actually doing is
linking commits to the previous commit.

4
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:22,910
So this is a linear flow
of commits because we are

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,469
putting commits on top
of the previous commit.

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,149
However, when we want to incorporate any
new feature without breaking existing code,

7
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:34,729
we need to work with branches.

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,799
What is a branch?

9
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:40,240
A branch represents an
independent line of development.

10
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,570
Let's say you want to work on a
user login feature in your project.

11
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,700
So what you will do is
that you will cut a new

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,969
feature branch in order to independently

13
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,740
work without breaking any
existing changes on the master branch.

14
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:00,840
All the commits that we
will do on user login

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,439
feature branch will
exist only on that branch.

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,359
This will make sure that we don't
affect the master branch changes.

17
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:14,489
Technically, a branch is nothing
but just a pointer to commits.

18
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:22,079
So when you create a branch, all what Git
needs to do is just create a new pointer.

19
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,579
It doesn't change the
repository in any way.

20
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,319
So let's say you had a master
branch, which is referring to commit C3.

21
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,230
Now, when you commit a feature branch,
You will say git branch feature branch.

22
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,939
Git will just create a new pointer for it,

23
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:46,140
and all the changes that you will do
will be a part of the feature branch.

24
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,319
So now the feature branch will be
pointing to the latest commit, which is C6,

25
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,930
but the master branch
would still be pointing to C3.

26
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,750
Talking more about the
master branch or main branch,

27
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,109
so this is a default branch which you
get when you create a new repository.

28
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,479
This is created by default by Git.

29
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,479
It's just like any other branch,
just that it's an initial branch.

30
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:19,389
GitHub now has changed the
naming of this branch to main branch.

31
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,750
So in a lot of places, you will see the
main name is getting used more often.

32
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:27,379
Also, it depends on the organization,

33
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:30,189
which name they want to
keep for their initial branch.

34
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:35,530
Usually we have main, master, and
trunk, some of the common names.

35
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,360
Let's go back to our project.

36
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,879
So we are right now on the main branch.

37
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,539
You can verify this with git status.

38
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:55,469
Let's make some changes to file one,
and let's say git branch demo one.

39
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:07,810
Let's add this commit, git
commit minus m branch demo.

40
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,560
Let's verify with the git log, and
we have made this branch demo commit.

41
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,770
Now, this is my main branch,
which already has some commits,

42
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:23,789
but now I want to make a new
feature, which is user login.

43
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,490
So I will create a new branch.

44
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:31,210
You can use git branch,
the name of the new branch.

45
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,770
Let's say user login.

46
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,719
We talked about that in
order to switch to the branch,

47
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,419
we can use git checkout command.

48
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:48,030
So we can use git checkout, the
name of the newly created branch.

49
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:55,969
So now if you make any changes,
it should be only on this branch.

50
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,129
So let's change the file one.txt.

51
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:04,240
Let's say user login feature.

52
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:20,019
And commit this, git add all, git
commit, minus m, user login demo.

53
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,810
Now, if I check my Git log,

54
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:33,649
so this was the branch demo commit
from where I created my new branch.

55
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:37,310
So this was the commit from
where I initialized my new branch.

56
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,500
And I made another commit,
which is user login demo.

57
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:50,930
Now, if I go back to the master,
git checkout, git checkout main,

58
00:04:53,310 --> 00:05:00,040
I'm using main and master
interchangeably, so when I say master, it can be main,

59
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,519
so just make sure that
it's the same main branch.

60
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:09,629
Now, if I go back to
the main, checkout main,

61
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:12,689
and let's check the history with git log.

62
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:19,360
Here you can see there is no
commit related to user login feature,

63
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,420
which means that in my user login branch,

64
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,620
I can make as many commits
without affecting the main branch.

65
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:31,459
So in this way, I created an
independent line of development

66
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:34,459
for my feature by using a separate branch.
