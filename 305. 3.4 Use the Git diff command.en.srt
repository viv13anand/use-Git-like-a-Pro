00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,320
Let's quickly see what
git diff command is.

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,900
So this command tells you
the differences between the

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,919
current version of the
files and your last commit.

4
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,019
Let's see how this looks like.

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:28,070
So let's say I change
here login functionality.

6
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,770
Now if I want to see what is the
difference, then I can do git diff,

7
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,890
and this will tell me what
is the difference between

8
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,770
my current changes from the last commit.

9
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:51,789
So in the last commit, it was bug,
but I have added login functionality.

10
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,189
So it will tell with the green
that you have made this change,

11
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,039
but your previous commit had bug.

12
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,950
There is another way. So
I don't use diff command

13
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,129
a lot because I prefer to
use Visual Studio Code.

14
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:11,620
So if you go to the source control
again, and then just click on the file,

15
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,909
and this will tell you that
this was the previous change,

16
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,900
and this is the new
change which you have added.

17
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,159
But feel free to use git diff command.

18
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:23,519
So it only compares with the last commit,

19
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,000
but you can also compare
with the Previous, more

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,150
previous commits, let's
say, let's see git log.

21
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:36,730
Let's say I want to
check with this commit,

22
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:42,519
what is the difference between my
current version and the second last commit.

23
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:51,549
So I will do git diff the commit
hash, And it says that commit had login,

24
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:54,459
but your current version
has login functionality.

25
00:01:55,019 --> 00:02:00,609
So with the diff command, you can
basically compare your changes with any commit.

26
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,670
So that was it about get diff command.
