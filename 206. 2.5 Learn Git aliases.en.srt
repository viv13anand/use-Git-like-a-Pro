1
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:09,869
In Git, we are basically
dealing with a lot of commands,

2
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:12,130
and some of these
commands are really long.

3
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:16,750
So what we can do is that
we can set up aliases for

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,899
those long commands so
that it's easy for us to use.

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,739
Let's see how we can do it.

6
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:26,199
The first way I'm going to
show you is using the git config.

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,850
So we would be adding aliases for
the commands in the git config.

8
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:33,229
Let's see how to do this.

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:42,909
So let's open our Code.getconfig.

10
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,259
Let's open our config
file. And here I want to,

11
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:53,060
there are already some aliases
existing. Okay, so basically,

12
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,439
you can add s for status.

13
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:59,020
Let's say I want to add

14
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:13,709
PP for push, or just P
for push, or actually pull.

15
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:21,090
So let's say P for pull,
S for status, L for log.

16
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:26,939
So instead of using
now the whole commands,

17
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,049
I can use this abbreviations like aliases.

18
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:37,620
So if I just go, and here I
use, instead of git status,

19
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,400
so this tells me the
status, but I can use git s,

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,180
and that will execute the same command.

21
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:52,670
If I want to do the log, then I can do
git l, and this will tell me the log.

22
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,140
So this is git log hyphen hyphen one line.

23
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,040
So we have...

24
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:02,939
Change this command, created alias,
and it's simply we can write git l.

25
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,450
Similar for the git add, you can do git a,

26
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,020
and it will nothing to add
because we don't have any changes here.

27
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,500
And for commit, you can also do git add.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,550
CI, I have added, you can create any
alias, like you can also do just C, so get C.

29
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:32,360
This is also good, but there is
another way, which I'm going to show you.

30
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,669
And that is more convenient
because here we are still

31
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:38,330
writing git and then we
are writing the commands.

32
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,490
So another way to do it
is by setting up those

33
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,280
aliases in your shell, like .zrc file.

34
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,909
If you're using bash, then you
add these aliases in your bash rc.

35
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:59,860
So just copy these aliases, alias GST,
like I've created GST for Git status,

36
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:06,789
which means that whenever I will use
GST, it will execute Git status command.

37
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,629
Then for Git clone, I can
use GCL, GA for Git add.

38
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:15,680
You can add a lot many
aliases as you want.

39
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,050
There are a lot more
available on the internet,

40
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,750
but these are the basic
ones which I use a lot.

41
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,849
So you can just copy it and
add it to your ZSHRC file.

42
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:32,560
I will show you how to do it in your
ZSHRC. So let's see how to do this.

43
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,710
So first, you need to
open your ZSHRC file.

44
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,930
If you are working with bash
shell, then you will have bash rc.

45
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:46,870
So let's open ZSHRC.

46
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:52,159
So I'm using this theme, power level 9K.

47
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:55,840
So this theme already
comes with those aliases.

48
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,530
So even though I have not added any of
those aliases, it still works for me.

49
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:07,930
But you can add your
own, like here, alias, GST.

50
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:13,639
And git status.

51
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,050
Let's try. So we have aliases
set. You can add as much as one.

52
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:26,220
More for git add, git add
all, or git commit as well.

53
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:33,629
So here, let's try it
out, and let's run GST,

54
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:37,779
and now it executes
the git status command.

55
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:44,839
It's really helpful because as you work
with a lot of commands like git checkout,

56
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:50,009
there will be a lot more commands that
will be coming in the next sections.

57
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,029
If you create aliases, it's
really fast to work with git.

58
00:04:56,329 --> 00:05:02,290
For example, if I have to make any
commit, I can just do gc-m and my commit message.

59
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:11,350
So right now, there is no file, no
changes, so there is nothing to be committed,

60
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,180
but if you just do any
change, let's change one file.

61
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,060
This is changed.

62
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:38,360
Let's add one more file,
file3.txt, aliases demo.

63
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:46,550
So now if I need to do all this, all the
steps like adding, committing, pushing,

64
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,509
I can do it with the aliases really fast.

65
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:53,490
Like first I can do GAA,
which is for git add all.

66
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,600
This is something which I have
created for adding all files. Of course,

67
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,220
you can write git add dot.

68
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:09,310
But I just took it, add all, GST, all
files are added, and then I have to commit,

69
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,379
then GC minus M, area says demo.

70
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,290
And if I want to check if this
is committed or not, I do glg,

71
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:24,350
and this tells me that you have a
commit already made to the local repo.

72
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,649
So these are the two ways
you can create Git aliases.

73
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:32,389
You can either
configure it in your Git config

74
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:36,129
file, or you can go with
the ZSHRC, add your...

75
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,759
Aliases in the ZSH-RC and work with that.

76
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:45,740
So both are good. I prefer the
ZSH-RC. You can use whichever you prefer.
