00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,470
Welcome to lesson six,
merging and rebasing in Git.

2
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:13,759
In this lesson, we'll explore
two fundamental Git concepts

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,859
that help you integrate
changes from different branches,

4
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,800
which is merging and rebasing.

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,320
Mastering these tools will
allow you to handle collaboration

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,120
and streamline your project
history more effectively.

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,019
We'll begin with theory
and concepts behind merging,

8
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:33,409
followed by hands-on practice
with merge commands in Git.

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,229
Then we'll switch to rebase,

10
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:40,740
starting with a deep dive into theory
and practical application of rebasing.

11
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:44,479
After that, we will
compare and contrast the two

12
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,240
approaches to help you
decide which one to use.

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,689
Then we'll learn how to
create pull requests,

14
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:53,420
an essential part of
collaboration in Git projects.

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,140
Finally, we wrap up with a
summary and an exercise.

16
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,240
That's the plan for this
lesson. Let's get started.
