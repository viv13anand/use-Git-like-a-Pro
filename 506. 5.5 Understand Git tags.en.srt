1
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,330
So tags are basically
bookmarks on your commit so that

2
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,359
you can easily find them and
reuse if needed in future.

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,899
They are mainly used to mark
the releases so that you can

4
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:22,289
easily move back to the
previous release if required.

5
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,809
There are mainly two types of tags.
First one is the lightweight tag.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,479
In this tag, you only add
a tag name to the commit

7
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:36,350
without adding any additional information.

8
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,369
Then we have annotated tags.

9
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:44,649
In this, you store additional
information, including the tagger's name, email,

10
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:47,659
and date, as well as the tag message.

11
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:54,240
In order to create a lightweight tag,
you can write git tag and name of the tag.

12
00:00:55,119 --> 00:01:02,609
For the annotated tag, you can write
git tag minus a to tell that it's an

13
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:08,689
annotated tag with the tag name
minus m and description about the tag.

14
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:16,849
In order to list all the tags,
you can use git tag command.

15
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:23,030
Then to push your tags, you can
use git push origin name of the tag.

16
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,230
For deleting the tag, you
can use git tag minus t.

17
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:33,219
This time minus t is with
small d, and then name of the tag.

18
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,049
This will delete the tag
on your local machine,

19
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,790
but if you want to delete it
from the remote server as well,

20
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,349
you need to push the deleted tag.

21
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:50,750
So for that, you need to do git push
origin hyphen hyphen delete tag name.

22
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,090
Let's practice all of this.
Let's create tags, list tags,

23
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,640
and also see how we can
push and delete tags.

24
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:02,239
Let's go back to our repository.

25
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:05,920
Now, why would you need a tag?

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,580
It is basically to mark the releases.

27
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:18,590
So let's say I In my main
branch, I have a couple of features,

28
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,639
and I want to mark this
commit as the release one,

29
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:28,240
which means that till this
commit, it's the release one.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,479
So release one has all the
commits till this last commit.

31
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:41,080
So what I can do is I can
bookmark the last commit with git tag.

32
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,180
Firstly, I need to create a tag.

33
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,900
So we can create a lightweight tag.

34
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:55,080
Let's say git tag v1.0 or just v1.

35
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:05,509
Now, if I do git log, it tells me that,
okay, this commit is associated with a tag.

36
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:16,680
Now, if I make more
commits to this, let's say

37
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:24,050
tag demo1, git add, git commit, tag demo.

38
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:35,509
Let's check git log, and now I
have this commit with the tag v1,

39
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:41,060
so it's easy for me to go
back to this release one

40
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,750
in case anything
breaks in the next release.

41
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,199
It's always easier to roll back to the
previous release with the help of tags.

42
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,099
Let's create some more commits.

43
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:07,629
Commit "-am tag-demo2".

44
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:24,519
This time I will create an
annotated tag, so git Tag minus A.

45
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:32,410
So we tell what is the name
of the tag. Let's call it v2.

46
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,100
And then we also need to
specify the description.

47
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,540
So this is release two.

48
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,290
Now let's do git log.

49
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,949
So now I have two tags.

50
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:56,199
This V1 tag is for release
one, and then I have V2 tag,

51
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:59,410
which is associated
with tag demo to commit.

52
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:05,899
In order to see all the tags you
have, you can use git tag command,

53
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:08,339
and it will list all the tags.

54
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:16,939
Now, if I want to see what the tag
has, I can use git show name of the tag.

55
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:19,759
Let's see what v2 tag has.

56
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,879
Now, it tells me that the
tag name is v2, who tagged it,

57
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:29,439
and what was the
description when it was added,

58
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:34,990
and also it tells me what was
the commit on which it was tagged.

59
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:45,610
Similarly, if we want to see v1, let's
see git show v1, and in the v1, yeah,

60
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:50,850
we have the commit, but we don't
have additional information like

61
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:55,620
description and other things
because this was a lightweight tag,

62
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,480
so we don't have extra information.

63
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:11,480
Now let's say something broke in V2 and
I want to roll back to my V1 release.

64
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:19,199
So I can do is move to the V1
tag by using git checkout command.

65
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:27,540
Here I will use the tag name V1
because I want to move back to the V1 tag.

66
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:32,129
So now we have moved to a tag.

67
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:36,930
That is why Git is telling me that
you are in a detached head state.

68
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,769
So this state comes when
you are not on a branch.

69
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:45,589
If you move to a commit, Git will tell
you the same, that you are in detached head.

70
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:50,670
So now whenever we want to work
from here, we need to create a branch.

71
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:59,410
So we will do git checkout
minus b release one, let's say.

72
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:08,980
And now if I do git log, this
has all the commits till v1.

73
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:16,730
And if I want to deploy the release
one again, I can deploy this branch.

74
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:20,350
Lastly, let's see how to delete tags.

75
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:27,670
So let's move back to the
main branch, git checkout main.

76
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:36,560
So we have V1 and V2 tags,
let's delete the V1 tag.

77
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:41,360
Get tag minus T and name of the tag.

78
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,379
So this says deleted tag V1.

79
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:52,470
Right now, this tag, we had not pushed
it, so this only existed on our local.

80
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:57,990
If the tag was already pushed, we
would have to also push the deleted tag.

81
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,529
So that was about
tags, how to create tags,

82
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:05,939
when to use tags, and how to delete tags.
