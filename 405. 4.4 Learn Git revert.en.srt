1
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:12,599
Git revert command also undoes the
commits, but instead of removing the commit,

2
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,219
it creates an additional
commit undoing that change.

3
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:20,339
The commit that is created
is called a revert commit.

4
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,039
So let's see what is the difference
between the reset and git revert,

5
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,530
because in the previous section, we
used git reset to remove our commits.

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:39,270
So with the git reset, let's say we
want to reset the two commits, C4 and C5.

7
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,880
With the git reset, the
head will move to C3.

8
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:48,659
Which means that we will not have
C4 and C5 in our commit history,

9
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:51,659
and that we also saw with the git log.

10
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:56,450
The issue with git reset is that
you can lose the shared history.

11
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:03,049
Let's say you had these five
commits in your master branch,

12
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:07,480
and somebody has created
another branch from the commit C4.

13
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,920
Now you do git reset and remove C4 and C5.

14
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:19,239
Now, the other person who is
working on the same project has C4

15
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:22,719
and C5 and has the work
which is based on these

16
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,930
two commits, but you have removed it.

17
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,209
And now if you push the removed commits,

18
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:33,459
then there will not be any
history regarding those commits.

19
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,099
So this can be a bit risky.

20
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,370
So instead of doing git reset,

21
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:45,590
if the commits are already pushed to
the remote server, we use git revert.

22
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:52,219
What Git revert does is that
it creates a new commit that

23
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:54,879
matches the historical
state of the previous commit.

24
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,340
Also, Git revert doesn't
change any project history.

25
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,950
So what Git revert will do in this
case is that it will create an additional

26
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:11,900
commit So this commit will
undo the changes of C4 and C5,

27
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,870
but in the history, you will still
see that you had C4 and C5 commit.

28
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:22,710
And now you have created a separate
commit with undoing those changes.

29
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,389
So this is a safe approach,

30
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:29,159
especially in case your commits
are pushed to the remote server.

31
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,060
So to sum up, Git revert does
not change the project history,

32
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,009
which makes it safe for
the commits which are

33
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:38,979
already published on
this shared repository.

34
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,639
Let's practice the Git revert command.

35
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,520
So let's go back to our project.

36
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,000
I will again change the two files.

37
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:53,569
Now instead of git restore,

38
00:02:53,569 --> 00:03:04,669
let me do it git revert demo1
and git revert demo1 file2.

39
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,810
Let's commit this.

40
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:25,750
git commit minus am git revert
demo1 Let's check the git log command,

41
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,469
and we have made this git
reward demo one commit.

42
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,009
Now, what I want to do
is I want to remove this

43
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:36,300
commit because let's say
I accidentally made it

44
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,729
and I want to undo the
changes or I want to undo

45
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:42,009
the changes because
there was some bug here.

46
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,060
So I will just copy the commit hash.

47
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:53,250
Now, instead of doing git
reset, I will do git revert.

48
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:00,780
This hash belongs to the
commit which you want to revert.

49
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:04,770
So because I wanted to
revert the last commit,

50
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,490
so I copied the hash of the last commit.

51
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:18,860
So once I do git revert, now git asks me
to To write a message for the reverted commit, automatically

52
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,850
Git assigns a message.
It says revert and same

53
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,629
message which I had
provided to that commit.

54
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,529
So let's use the default message.

55
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:38,189
Now if I do git log, I have another
commit which reverts this commit.

56
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:44,480
So if you see file one and file
two, I have git restore demo 3,

57
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,250
but I had changed it to git revert demo 1.

58
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:53,870
So the changes are restored, but we
have also maintained the history.

59
00:04:54,889 --> 00:05:00,810
We know that this commit was made to the
branch, but we also got the changes back.
