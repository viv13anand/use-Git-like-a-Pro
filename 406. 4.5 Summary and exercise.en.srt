00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:09,160
To recap what we learned in this lesson,

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,630
so first we talked
about git checkout command.

3
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,849
Git checkout can be
used to do three things.

4
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,750
First, we can use the checkout
command to switch between the branches.

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,640
We can use git checkout to also
restore the changes in the files.

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,390
Also saw that with Git checkout,
you can also move to any commit,

7
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,439
but you would be in a detached head state.

8
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,140
Then we saw restoring
files with git restore.

9
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,439
With git restore, you can move to
the file version of any commit.

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,530
Also with the git restore,
we can unstage the files.

11
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:53,119
Then we saw that the Git reset,
how we can remove the commits.

12
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,240
There are two types of
resets we talked about.

13
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,060
One is the soft reset, in
which you will remove the commits,

14
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,269
but still have those changes
in your working directory.

15
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:08,939
There is a hard reset. In that
case, you will remove the commits,

16
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,359
but you will lose the changes.

17
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,730
Then we talked about reverting commits,

18
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:19,510
how we can undo the changes in
the commit with git revert command.

19
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,859
We also saw that git
revert command is safer,

20
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:28,500
especially when you have the commits
already pushed to the shared repo.

21
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,290
With git revert command, git
automatically creates a revert commit,

22
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,230
which has all the reverted changes.

23
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,870
Moving on to the exercise.

24
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,019
So what I want you to do is create
three commits in the master branch.

25
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:48,590
Permanently delete last two commits.

26
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,439
So you should not have those changes
in your working directory as well.

27
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,359
Third, create two more commits
and try to revert the last commit.
