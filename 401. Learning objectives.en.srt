Welcome to lesson four, Undoing Changes.

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,289
In this lesson, we will explore
the essential commands in Git that

3
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:16,679
help you reverse or modify
changes in your project history.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,660
These are invaluable when
you need to fix mistakes.

5
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:26,149
We will begin by learning how
to use git checkout command

6
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:29,059
to switch between
branches and restore files,

7
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:33,649
followed by understanding git restore
command to revert working directory changes.

8
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:39,109
Then we'll dive into Git reset
to undo commits. And finally,

9
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:40,780
we'll explore Git revert,

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,359
a command used to undo changes
safely in a collaborative environment.

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,049
And to check your understanding,
we'll run through an exercise.

12
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:52,490
That's the roadmap for this
lesson. Let's get started.
