1
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,330
Let's go back to our repository.

2
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:19,969
So right now we are on main git
status. We are on main branch.

3
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:27,480
Let's check the last two
commits. On our main branch,

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,879
we have tagdemo and
tagdemo2 as our last commits.

5
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,509
Now I'll create a new
feature branch, git checkout,

6
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:41,229
and I will be moving to this branch.

7
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:46,649
Feature merge demo.

8
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,859
Let's change the file one dot txt.

9
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,740
I'll make it merge demo commit one.

10
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:12,939
Let's make a commit, git add all, git
commit, minus m, merge demo, commit one.

11
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:17,920
Let's make another commit.

12
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:25,799
We'll use the same
command, and I will use "-am".

13
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,120
This adds and creates commit together.

14
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:31,799
Merge commit demo two.

15
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,989
And then I do git log, and
here we have the two commits.

16
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:45,269
Now I'm going to merge this
feature branch into main branch.

17
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:50,609
For that, I will first need
to move to the main branch.

18
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:53,920
Git checkout main.

19
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,480
Now I do git merge.

20
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:03,540
The name of the branch
which I want to merge,

21
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,310
which in my case is feed slash merge demo.

22
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:14,490
Once I run this command, you must have
noticed that it is a fast forward merge.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,219
The reason for that was that
there were no more commits

24
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:22,159
in the main branch when
I started to merge this.

25
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,469
So now my commit history
looks like the tag demo two,

26
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:32,449
and then merge commit
one, merge demo commit two.

27
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,520
So what Git had to do
was just put the commits

28
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,020
of the feature branch on the main branch,

29
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,830
and that is why it was
a fast-forward merge.

30
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,719
Next we'll see the three-way merge.

31
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,590
Let's create another branch.

32
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:59,770
Git checkout minus B.
Feature three-way merge.

33
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:07,789
I'll make two commits
in this branch as well.

34
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,490
Three-way merge.

35
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:15,909
Commit one.

36
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:19,889
Git add all.

37
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:24,370
Git commit minus m.

38
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,969
Three-way merge, commit one.

39
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,830
Let's do another commit as well.

40
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:36,530
Get add all.

41
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,879
Get commit, three-way merge, commit two.

42
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,330
Now before merging, What
I want to do is I want

43
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,659
to make additional
commits to the main branch.

44
00:03:52,360 --> 00:04:00,669
So I will go to main
branch and change or create

45
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:04,259
another file. Let's create file3.txt.

46
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:15,629
File 3 created to show merge commit.

47
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:28,339
git add all, git commit,
minus m, file 3 changes.

48
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:39,759
So now our main branch has
this commit file three changes.

49
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:48,949
And if I go back to my feature branch,
get checkout feature three-way merge.

50
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,949
My feature branch does not
know anything about file three.

51
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:01,170
So the commit which I made to the
master branch is not in this feature branch.

52
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,060
So now both the branches
have different commits.

53
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:10,310
Let's see what happens
when I try to merge the

54
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,040
feature branch into
master branch in this case.

55
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:20,889
I will go to my main
branch, git checkout main, and

56
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:25,709
I will do git merge,
feature three-way merge.

57
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,459
So here, now Git is trying
to create a merge commit,

58
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:35,810
and it asks you to
enter the commit message.

59
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,990
You can enter your own commit message,

60
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,199
or just choose the
default message created by Git.

61
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:47,360
So I will do colon Q,
exit it so that I can

62
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,279
choose the one which is added by the Git.

63
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,860
Now let's check the history.

64
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,420
And in Git log, we have a merge commit,

65
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,319
which says merge branch
feature three-way merge.

66
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:07,769
This merge commit was created because
both the branches had different commits

67
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:12,759
when I was trying to merge the
feature branch into the main branch.

68
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,769
Let's also talk about conflicts.

69
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:26,430
Let's create a new branch.

70
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,740
Merge conflicts.

71
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,399
Let's change the file
one, merge conflicts.

72
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:58,490
Let's commit this file,
merge conflicts demo.

73
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:06,370
I forgot to add, so let's add
it, and then make a commit.

74
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,430
Now, in this branch, I have
changed the file1.txt content.

75
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,839
I will go to the main
branch and change the same file.

76
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,920
So let's go to main.

77
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:29,410
In file one, let's do a change.

78
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,680
Main branch file one content.

79
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:43,470
And make a comment, comment.

80
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:57,170
Now in this case, both the
branches, feature branch and main branch,

81
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,529
has different content in file1.txt.

82
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:03,670
So in both the cases,
the same file is changed.

83
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:10,829
Now when I try to merge the
feature branch, merge conflicts,

84
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:19,939
Git is going to show me the conflicts
that in, we talked about that head.

85
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:24,100
It tells you the current branch
changes, which is our main branch.

86
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,990
So it says you have main branch file one
content, this text in your main branch,

87
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,629
and in your feature branch, you
have merge conflicts demo text.

88
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:39,559
Now you can either accept changes from
your current branch or incoming changes,

89
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:42,600
or you can also accept both the changes.

90
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,559
You can resolve these changes
using Visual Studio Code Editor.

91
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,129
So here I will do accept both changes.

92
00:08:54,330 --> 00:09:00,509
Once you have resolved the
changes, you need to do git add all,

93
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:03,360
and then do git merge continue.

94
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,710
Since this was a three-way merge,

95
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,850
git will ask you the
message for the merge commit.

96
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,090
You can choose the default
message or type your own.

97
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,100
In this case, I'm choosing the
default one, colon Q, exit it.

98
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,740
Let's check our log, and
there is a merge commit,

99
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,940
but we have successfully
merged our feature branch,

100
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,940
and now this file one
has both the changes from

101
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,529
the main branch as well
as the feature branch.

102
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,200
So right now we saw
three cases while merging.

103
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:44,820
The first one we saw
was fast-forward merge,

104
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,730
in which there were no more changes
in the main branch while merging.

105
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,509
So Git could simply
apply all the changes of

106
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,230
feature branch on top of the main branch.

107
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,379
This is what is fast forward merge.

108
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,409
But in a lot of scenarios,
actually maximum scenarios,

109
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:06,309
people would be
working on the main branch.

110
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:11,289
So by the time when you come to
merge your feature branch into main,

111
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:14,419
there are likely to be
more commits in the main.

112
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:20,210
In that case, Git will
create a merge commit to dissolve

113
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,009
the different commits
in both the branches.

114
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:26,740
Lastly, we also talked
about merge conflicts.

115
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:31,789
Merge conflicts occur when you
change same file in both the branches.

116
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:37,019
So while merging, it does not
know which version to accept.

117
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:43,070
So right now we have seen how to
merge our feature changes into the main.

118
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:48,330
So we are integrating our feature
branch into the main branch using merge,

119
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:52,769
but we also have another
way to do it using rebase.

120
00:10:53,429 --> 00:10:57,950
In the next section, we'll talk about
that, how to use rebase to do the same.
