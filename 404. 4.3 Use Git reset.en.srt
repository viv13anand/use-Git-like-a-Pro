1
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:11,269
You can use git reset command to
move files from stage to unstage.

2
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:16,980
You can do the same with git restore
as well, but the command is a bit long.

3
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:21,469
With git reset, you can simply
do git reset, the file name.

4
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,320
And if you want to move all of
your files to the unstaging area,

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,070
you can do git reset dot.

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,420
One interesting thing
which you can do with

7
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,679
the git reset command
is to remove commits.

8
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:36,560
So there can be two types of reset.

9
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:39,649
First one is that you can do a hard reset.

10
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,000
What a hard reset does
is that it will remove

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,350
the commits and don't keep your changes.

12
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:53,960
The command for it is git reset, the
commit hash, where you want to reset to,

13
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,820
and use hyphen hyphen hard.

14
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:58,700
Another one is a soft reset.

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,149
So this will remove the commits,

16
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:04,569
but all the changes will be
back in your working directory.

17
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,500
You can run git reset,
just the commit hash,

18
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,400
or you can also use hyphen
hyphen soft, but by default,

19
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,069
if you use git reset with commit
hash, it is going to do a soft reset.

20
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:22,909
git reset command is really
helpful if you accidentally

21
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:26,239
make a commit to a branch
and you want to remove it.

22
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,989
So this is the time when you would be
using git reset command a lot of times.

23
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:35,409
Now let's practice these three things.

24
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:39,290
Resetting your files from
staging area to unstaging area.

25
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,379
Desetting to a commit.

26
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,459
So we are back to the Git
video course repository.

27
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:51,700
In the file one, let's change
the text to Git reset demo.

28
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,299
Also, let's change the
file to Git reset demo two.

29
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,829
Now, in order to add these
files in the staging area,

30
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:08,250
we can do git add dot git status.

31
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:09,870
We have added it.

32
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,780
And now, in order to unstage it, it's
easier to do it with git reset dot.

33
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:24,080
Now if I do git status, the files
have been moved to unstaging area.

34
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:31,300
If you want to unstage just a
particular file, let's add it again,

35
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,990
and you can do git reset
and the name of the file.

36
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,629
Let's run the git status command again,

37
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:47,000
and you can see we have only moved
file1.txt into the unstaging area.

38
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,810
You could do the same
using git restore command,

39
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,930
which we talked in the previous section.

40
00:02:53,569 --> 00:03:02,560
git restore, not a resort, git restore,
and hyphen hyphen staged, and the file name.

41
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:10,060
But this is a bit
inconvenient, or a bit long, I would say.

42
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,280
So mostly we can run the
git reset command to do this.

43
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:22,430
The second thing which we can do
with git reset is to remove commits.

44
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:25,889
So let's first make some commits.

45
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:31,090
Let's commit our files, git add all.

46
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:38,710
Git commit, minus m, reset demo1.

47
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:50,199
Let's change the files
again to file2, demo2, file1.

48
00:03:52,629 --> 00:04:02,939
I've changed both the files again, and
let's commit them, git add all, git commit,

49
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:06,379
minus m, reset, demo two.

50
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,639
Now let's run git log.

51
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:19,029
Now we want to remove two previous
commits, resetDemo1 and resetDemo2.

52
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,100
So I will copy the hash
of one previous commit,

53
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,129
because this is the commit
where I want to move back to,

54
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:28,800
removing my top two commits.

55
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,680
So I'll copy the hash.

56
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:38,459
And I will do git reset to this commit.

57
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:46,970
Now I get the changes back, git status.

58
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:55,259
So there are changes in my working
directory, but if I check git log,

59
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,199
The commits have been removed.
There are no commits for git reset.

60
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,250
It's only for restore. So we have
successfully reset the commits,

61
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:24,079
So this is useful in case you made some
commits, but you want to make more changes.

62
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,100
So you can just reset them and make
final changes and then commit them again.

63
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:36,589
So this was a soft reset because the
changes are in your working directory.

64
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:43,970
If I commit it again, let's
change these files again.

65
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:45,509
First, git.

66
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:51,899
Okay, file.

67
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:57,970
Demo1 and Demo1.

68
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:02,569
Let's make two commits again.

69
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:13,149
Get commit minus M, reset Demo1.

70
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,269
Demo two, file two.

71
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,430
I'm making one more commit.

72
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,319
Demo two, file one.

73
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:35,610
So let's make another commit, git
add all, git commit, reset demo2.

74
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:42,329
Let's verify in the git log. I have
made two commits, demo1 and demo2.

75
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,980
Now I'm going to remove it, but
I'm going to do a hard reset.

76
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:51,560
So we do the same thing
just with the hard flag.

77
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:58,189
So copy the hash one before we want to
move to the restore demo three commit.

78
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,290
So I will copy the hash.

79
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:10,170
And here I can say git reset
hyphen hyphen hard and the commit hash.

80
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:20,040
So now if I check git log,
there are no commits for the reset.

81
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,939
But I also have lost all the
changes which I made because git status.

82
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:33,329
Doesn't show me any changes.
So I change these two files,

83
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:36,100
but I don't have those changes anymore.

84
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:40,149
So whenever you are
using git reset with heart,

85
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:43,990
just be conscious that you
will lose all the changes.

86
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:47,480
So in case you want to
still have those changes,

87
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,730
but you want to remove the
commits as well. So do a soft reset.
