1
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:08,500
Let's practice the rebase commands.

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,710
We would be rebasing
feature branch on main.

3
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:15,830
Then we will also see how to
handle conflicts with rebase.

4
00:00:16,489 --> 00:00:19,179
And finally, we'll see
how the history looks

5
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:21,530
different than merging in case of rebase.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,699
Let's go back to our editor.

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,940
And now we want to
create another feature branch

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,740
get checkout minus P feature rebase demo.

9
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,509
Let's create a new file.

10
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:47,259
Dot TXT.

11
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,009
So rebase demo commit one.

12
00:00:55,409 --> 00:01:05,549
Let's commit these changes. Git add all,
git commit minus m, rebase demo commit one.

13
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:17,230
Let's make another commit with minus am.

14
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:24,420
So we have made two commits,
rebase demo one and rebase demo two.

15
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:36,150
Let's go back to our master
branch, git checkout main,

16
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:43,310
and let's make another
commit in the main branch.

17
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:54,290
So I will say file, Four dot
txt changes from another person.

18
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:01,180
Let's commit these changes.

19
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:06,459
Commit minus m added file four.

20
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:14,819
Now if I do git log, it
has this additional commit

21
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:18,039
which my feature branch has no idea about.

22
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,250
Now, if I want to merge my
feature branch into main branch,

23
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:32,650
one way is that I can do git merge and my
feature branch, which is the base demo.

24
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:38,569
This command will merge the
feature branch into main branch,

25
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:43,169
but since this is not going
to be a fast-forward merge,

26
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:47,759
Git will create an additional
commit, which is a merge commit,

27
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,689
because both these
branches have different commits.

28
00:02:52,849 --> 00:03:00,180
Instead, what we can do is we
can go to our feature branch,

29
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:07,500
git checkout rebase demo, and this
time we can say git rebase main.

30
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:15,639
What rebase means is that we want to
change the base of the feature branch,

31
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:21,430
because when we created this feature
branch, it was on a different commit.

32
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,819
Afterwards, there were more
commits in the main branch,

33
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:28,280
and we want to incorporate those commits.

34
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,159
So with this command,
with git rebase main,

35
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:39,430
what git will do is that it will
pull the new changes in main and

36
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:44,870
put the changes in the feature
branch on top of the main commits.

37
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:49,349
So we do git rebase main.

38
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:54,560
And now you can see we
already have file four.

39
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:04,080
If we do git log, then we have added,
we have this commit added file four.

40
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,319
And one thing you would notice
is that how the history looks.

41
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:11,520
Because we have a commit from main,

42
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,969
and then we have the
commits from this feature branch.

43
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:21,670
So the commit into this feature branch
was put on top of the commits on main.

44
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,689
Now, if we merge, in order to merge, we
want to go back to our master branch,

45
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:35,649
which is our main branch.

46
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,740
And now if I run git
merge my feature branch.

47
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:51,120
In this case, it will be a fast
forward merge because now I have

48
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,350
incorporated the changes of main
branch into the feature branch.

49
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,879
So you can see Git says it's
a fast forward merge because

50
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:05,850
main did not hide any more
commits when I was merging.

51
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,420
Let's check the Git log.

52
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,600
And now you can see how
clear the history looks.

53
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:18,040
We have main commit, then we have
both the commits of our feature branch.

54
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:22,370
There is no additional
merge commit created by Git.

55
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,860
Let's also see the
conflicts while using DBase.

56
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:40,069
Let's create another feature branch
with get checkout minus P rebase demo two.

57
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,980
Let's call it with feet.

58
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:52,019
In this case, now
let's change the file one.

59
00:05:54,339 --> 00:06:01,810
And here I will see, I will change it
to rebase conflicts demo commit one.

60
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:19,149
Let's do git add all, git commit
minus m, rebase conflicts, commit one.

61
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:30,379
Let's go back to our main
branch and change the same file.

62
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:35,579
So file one, let's
change it to something else.

63
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,560
Rebase conflicts because of main changes.

64
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:57,069
Let's add it, git commit minus m.

65
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:07,060
Let's just give it any
message, conflicts from main.

66
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:16,329
Now what we have done is
that we have changed the same

67
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:19,029
file, which is
file1.txt, in both the branches.

68
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:25,730
Main has this text, whereas the
feature branch has a different text.

69
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:31,000
Now let's go back to our
feature branch, rebase.

70
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,800
Demo to get checkout.

71
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:47,579
Now, in order to run rebase, we need
to run this command get rebase main.

72
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:54,199
Now, since we have changed the
same file in both the branches,

73
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:56,129
we should see some conflicts.

74
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:03,449
Okay, so now Git is saying that you have
conflicts because in the current branch,

75
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,350
you have the changes which are in green.

76
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:07,730
It's the opposite.

77
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,490
In the green it says the conflicts
which are coming from the main branch,

78
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,750
and in the blue it says the
conflicts which are in the current branch.

79
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,509
We will resolve these changes.
You can choose whichever to accept.

80
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,370
Let's say we want to
also keep the main changes.

81
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,670
So we can do accept both changes.

82
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,610
Or if we just want to keep the current
change, then we can do accept current change.

83
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:48,419
Now we will do git add all and
git rebase hyphen hyphen continue.

84
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:58,429
Git will ask you to rewrite the message.

85
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:01,529
Let's use the default one for now.

86
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:07,460
And now we have resolved the changes.

87
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:14,360
So we have the file1.txt
with our accepted changes.

88
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,409
So this is how conflicts
look like while rebasing.

89
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,649
It's very much similar to the merging.

90
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:24,210
It's just on the different branch.

91
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:28,539
So once you resolve the changes,
it's easier to merge back to main.

92
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:34,990
So for that, we can do git checkout
main, and then do the same thing, git merge.

93
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:41,190
Feature rebase-demo2.

94
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,330
This will again be a fast-forward merge.

95
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:52,220
And then we have the commits
from the rebase-demo2 branch.

96
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,759
So this was about how
to use rebase when you

97
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,509
want to integrate your changes into main.

98
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:04,929
The main point here is
that when you use rebase,

99
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:07,200
there is no additional merge commit,

100
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,960
which makes your history looks
way cleaner and more linear.
