1
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:09,789
Before we jump into using
git fetch and git pull,

2
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:12,339
let's quickly see what git log command is.

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,779
So this command basically
tells you the history of

4
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:18,429
all the commits you have
made to the repository.

5
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,370
The history of commits include
hash, messages, and metadata.

6
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,019
We will be practicing three commands,
git log, git log hyphen hyphen author,

7
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:32,049
and git log hyphen hyphen one line.

8
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,350
Let's see what these commands look like.

9
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:41,590
So going back to our
previous project, git commit demo,

10
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:49,140
we already saw the git log command.
Let's recap again. So if we do git log,

11
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,780
it displays the
history of all the commits.

12
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:56,340
And in the commits, you can
see there is this long hash.

13
00:00:56,979 --> 00:01:00,750
So this is your hash,
which is used basically to

14
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,759
if you want to
identify a particular commit.

15
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:08,310
And then you have author who made
the commit and the commit message.

16
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,879
And if you have some metadata,
like commit footers or dates,

17
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,129
anything that is also
displayed in the Git log.

18
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,620
Now, if you want to filter
out the commits using author,

19
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:29,890
then you can do git log hyphen hyphen
author, and just type the name of the author.

20
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,250
So I wrote Ashima, and I can
see all the commits by Ashima.

21
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:40,109
If you just search by
author, let's say Pete,

22
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:44,310
it did not show any commits
because Pete did not make any commit.

23
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,939
Now, if you must have noticed in
the git log, it is like really long.

24
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,099
Sometimes what we only want to see
is like a concise version of it.

25
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,090
We only are concerned about
the author and maybe the hash.

26
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:07,549
So you can use git log
hyphen hyphen one line.

27
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:12,689
And this is much more cleaner. You can
view more commits and you can see the hash.

28
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:15,580
It doesn't show you the author, sorry,

29
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,900
but it shows you the commit
message and the commit hash.

30
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,699
So that was it about Git log command.
