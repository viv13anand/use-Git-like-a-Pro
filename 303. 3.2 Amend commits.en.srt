1
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:11,490
Now we know how to make a commit, but
let's see how we can amend a commit.

2
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,890
So we can basically, we
are going to do two things.

3
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,199
We are going to be amending a
commit message, and second,

4
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:21,609
we are going to be amending a
file in the existing commit.

5
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:23,679
Let's see how that looks.

6
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:28,719
Let's go back to our Git
video course repository.

7
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,049
So in the file one, I
will change the text.

8
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:37,250
So it is amending commits demo one.

9
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:49,179
Let's make this commit, git add all,
and git commit, amend commit, demo one.

10
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,789
Now let's say I want to amend this
commit message. So first of all,

11
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,109
I can check what the commit
message is by checking into git log.

12
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,269
So this is my commit message
for amend commit demo one.

13
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,049
Let's say I want to change this
commit message to something else.

14
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:18,140
So I can use this command, git commit,
hyphen hyphen amend, and then minus m,

15
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,859
and this is new commit message.

16
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,680
Now let's check git log.

17
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,489
And the commit message has been changed.

18
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:39,299
Now let's say I wanted to make another
change in the same commit, but I forgot.

19
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:46,599
Like, let's say I also wanted to
change this file, amend demo two.

20
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:52,060
I want to add file
two, but I want it to be

21
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,890
a part of this new commit message commit.

22
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:59,170
So how can I add this
file into the same commit?

23
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,120
I can do git, first of all, git add.

24
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:10,740
So we can do git commit, hyphen
hyphen amend, hyphen hyphen no edit.

25
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:14,139
We don't need to specify
any commit message because

26
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:17,009
we are adding this file
into the existing commit.

27
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:26,560
So now if you do git log,
And you check this commit.

28
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:30,949
So basically, it has now
two files instead of one.

29
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,840
And it says two files changed.
