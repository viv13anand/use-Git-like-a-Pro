00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:11,439
To recap what we learned in this
lesson, so first we talked about merging,

2
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:14,880
how we can merge our
features into the main branch.

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,070
Then we talked about how we can
use rebase to integrate our changes.

4
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,320
The benefit we saw with the rebase
is that there is no merge commit,

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,879
and we can update our feature branch
with the latest commits on the main branch.

6
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,820
Then we also saw how to handle conflicts
while merging and also while rebasing.

7
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:40,119
Finally, we talked about pull request.

8
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,079
We saw that directly merging
to master is not a great idea.

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,740
It can be risky and it doesn't
give your peers to review your code.

10
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,020
So that is why we create pull requests.

11
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:57,609
Pull requests will give a
chance to your peers to review

12
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:00,990
your code and then
suggest any feedback you have.

13
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:08,769
Going to the exercise,
I want you to create

14
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:12,510
a new Git repository
with name git-workshop,

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,250
create index.html file
with content hello world,

16
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,989
and push changes to your remote repo.

17
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,549
After you are done with creating a
repo, I want you to practice merging.

18
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:33,329
So create a feature branch with name
feature merge exercise from master.

19
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,530
Edit your index.html file
with changing text in the body.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,280
You can choose to create a new file as
well. It depends on what you want to do.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,260
Make a commit, go to master, this
time make two commits into the master.

22
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,500
Go to the feature branch and
merge master in your feature branch.

23
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,599
Now you should see the master
commits along with the merge commit.

24
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,840
I also want you to practice
rebase, so this is the next part.

25
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,800
For rebase, create a feature
branch again from the master,

26
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,349
edit your index.html file, make a
commit, go to master, make two commits again,

27
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:25,750
Go to the feature branch, and this
time use rebase in your feature branch.

28
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:30,150
There should be a difference in
the history that you should see.

29
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:33,719
Your commits would be
on top of the master,

30
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:36,240
and there would be no
additional merge commit.

31
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:39,840
Finally, also practice pull requests.

32
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:43,909
With the pull request,
part one is that you create

33
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:46,280
a bug fix branch from the master branch.

34
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,789
Change the text in index.html to
hello world from your country.

35
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,500
Push your branch to remote,

36
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,090
and this time merge the branch
to master using the pull request.

37
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,500
Verify the changes in master
branch and use git pull to see

38
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,860
if the changes have been
updated in your local repository.

39
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:15,800
As a part two, create
another branch from master,

40
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,360
change the text again,
and commit your changes.

41
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,740
Go back to the master
and change the text again.

42
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:28,990
Now go to your feature branch
and push your branch to remote.

43
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,689
Create a pull request. Now this time you
should see some conflicts while merging.
