00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:09,019
Before we talk about branching strategies,

2
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:11,839
let's first talk about
the branching workflow.

3
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:15,169
While we are working on a project,

4
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:20,059
our end goal is to integrate our
changes with other team members' changes.

5
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,609
We have a mainline workflow
where we work with a single branch,

6
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:26,199
which is our main branch.

7
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:30,460
All the commits are
made to this main branch,

8
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,469
and everyone is working and
contributing to the same main branch.

9
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:40,619
The benefit of it is that because of
single branch, it's easy to track changes,

10
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:44,000
but there is also a risk
of shipping big changes.

11
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,939
Since everyone is
committing to the same branch,

12
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:52,969
there is a risk that something will
break, which makes it less resilient.

13
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:58,590
We also need to make sure that we
have a high quality test environment

14
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,049
to make sure that nothing
breaks on the main branch.

15
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,500
That is why we have
different types of branches.

16
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:11,120
So we have feature branch, which is
generally created for developing any feature.

17
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:13,280
Then we have a develop branch.

18
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,560
We have a hotfix or bugfix
branches, release branch for the releases,

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,739
and main branch, which
is the default branch.

20
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:28,310
Now, in terms of branches, we have some
branches which are long-running branches,

21
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,159
and the other branches
are short-lived branches.

22
00:01:32,769 --> 00:01:35,969
Long running branches
are those branches which

23
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:38,709
stay throughout the course of development.

24
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,359
So we have a main branch,
which is the default branch.

25
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:45,969
And in some projects, we
also have a develop branch,

26
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:48,400
which is running
parallel to the main branch.

27
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,260
And it also persist as
a long running branch.

28
00:01:56,469 --> 00:02:02,620
We also have some short lib branches,
like feature branch or hotfix branch.

29
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,840
So for the short lib branches,
they are there only for a short time.

30
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,110
Once their purpose is
finished, they are deleted.

31
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,620
For example, if you have
to create a new feature,

32
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,550
you would be creating a feature branch.

33
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:20,199
But once your feature
development has been completed

34
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:22,849
and it's merged to the main branch,

35
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:25,500
you would be deleting the feature branch.

36
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:30,750
Same goes with the hotfix or
bugfix branch. When the bug is fixed,

37
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,050
we would delete the bugfix.

38
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,870
And also with the release
branch, once the release is done,

39
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,289
we delete the release branch.

40
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:41,530
Now that you know about
different types of branches,

41
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,229
let's discuss the branching strategies.

42
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:48,430
So the most common branching
strategies we have are Git flow,

43
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,879
and the second one is GitHub flow.

44
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,219
First, let's talk about the Git flow.

45
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:59,060
In Git flow, we have two
long-running branches.

46
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:04,319
One is the main branch, which always
reflect the current production state.

47
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,770
There is a second long-running
branch, which is typically called Develop.

48
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,419
All the features start from the
Develop branch, and once they are developed,

49
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:18,139
they are merged back
into the Develop branch.

50
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,050
Develop branch is also the
starting point for new releases.

51
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:29,349
So developers open a new release branch
from the develop branch and work on that,

52
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:32,750
test it in case there are any bug fixes.

53
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:35,349
It is fixed in the release branch.

54
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:41,770
And once everything works and you are
confident that it's ready for production,

55
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,409
you merge your release branch into main.

56
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:49,840
As the last step, you
add a tag for the release

57
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,639
commit on main and
delete the release branch.

58
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,270
This type of strategy works
well for package softwares

59
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,469
or libraries with frequent releases.

60
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,960
However, for website
projects where releases

61
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,330
are very frequent, it
might be an overkill.

62
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:13,439
So the next strategy
we have is GitHub Flow.

63
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,430
In this strategy, we only have one
long-running branch, which is the main branch.

64
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:25,600
You will cut all the branches, be
it a feature branch, bug fix branch,

65
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,389
everything from the main branch.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,009
Once your feature
development is completed,

67
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:34,040
you will merge it back to the main branch.

68
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,470
So this type of strategy is
easier and more straightforward.

69
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:47,430
I would suggest to use this if you
are working on a continuous delivery

70
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,420
project with short production
cycles and frequent releases.

71
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:56,480
So if your releases are like once in a
day or two times in a day, use GitHub Flow.

72
00:04:57,459 --> 00:05:01,680
It's extremely lean and simple.
There is only one long running branch,

73
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,589
which is the default main branch.

74
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:06,939
Talking about branch naming conventions,

75
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:10,509
we already talked about some
conventions for the commits.

76
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,720
Similarly, we have some naming
conventions for the branches as well.

77
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:20,639
So firstly, all the branch
names should be in lowercase.

78
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,290
So for example, with feature new
login, it has to be in the lowercase.

79
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,389
If there are multiple words,
use hyphens to separate words.

80
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,189
Don't use any underscores or spaces.

81
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,420
Use alphanumeric characters, so no
special symbols like dollar, underscore.

82
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:46,779
Names should be descriptive.

83
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,319
You can also include Jira ID in the name.

84
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,040
Like for example, for user authentication,

85
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,850
you can name it as feature slash your
Jira ID, then the name of the feature.

86
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,470
We have couple of
examples for the branch names.

87
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,040
So it needs to be start
with the type of the branch.

88
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:12,480
So we can say feature slash Jira ID. Your
Jira ticket ID, then name of the feature.

89
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,639
For the bug fix, it
should start with like bug

90
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,100
fix slash ticket ID and the description.

91
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,649
For release, it's like release slash
hotfix hotfix slash docs doc slash.

92
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,769
If there is any library update,

93
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:32,930
you can name it as core slash
your ticket ID and the description.

94
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,160
Now we know what are branches
and how to create branches,

95
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,360
how to switch between different branches.

96
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,959
Let's see how we can move commits
from one branch to another branch.

97
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:49,750
For that, first do git
log and copy the commit

98
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,110
hash of the commit which you want to move.

99
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,509
Then switch to the branch
where you want to move the commit.

100
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,240
For switching, you can use git
checkout, name of the branch,

101
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,610
and then use cherry pick command,
git cherry pick the commit hash.

102
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:11,290
We are back to the repo.

103
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:19,389
So let's create a new
branch, git checkout, minus b.

104
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:25,540
I'm also moving to this
branch, cherry pick demo.

105
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,550
Notice the name of the branch.

106
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:34,759
So I have created feed.

107
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:39,160
We also use feed or
sometimes feature, both are fine.

108
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,480
And then I have separated the
cherry pick demo with hyphens.

109
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:53,250
Now let's make a commit,
cherry pick this commit.

110
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,089
Let's add this commit.

111
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:06,610
Git commit minus m cherry pick demo.

112
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:11,329
Verify it from the git log.

113
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:16,730
So this is the commit that we
want to move to the main branch.

114
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,689
So first I will copy this hash.

115
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:28,120
Now I switch to the main
branch, git checkout main.

116
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:36,330
Check the git log. So right
now, we don't have that commit.

117
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,950
The last commit we have is head-demo-to.

118
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,690
In order to move the commit,
actually to copy the commit,

119
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,649
let's run this git
cherry-pick and the commit hash.

120
00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:00,429
Now, if we run git log, we have
cherry pick demo commit on this branch.

121
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,200
So this is how you can copy commits
from one branch to another branch.
