1
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:09,619
We talked about that our
end goal is to integrate

2
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:12,019
our work with the rest of our coworkers.

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:18,100
We saw two techniques to do it
using merging and using rebasing.

4
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:23,609
So far, we have been merging our
changes directly to the master branch,

5
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,989
but this is not the best way
because it doesn't leave a

6
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:31,649
scope for your changes to be
reviewed by your teammates.

7
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,700
There is another way to merge
your changes into the master branch,

8
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,750
which is by creating pull requests.

9
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:44,320
Now, pull requests are
not a feature of Git,

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,920
but is provided by Git hosting
platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,609
The main goal of pull request is to
merge your changes into the main branch.

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,960
The problems with merging directly
into the master are it's less resilient.

13
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:04,939
Also, there is no way to get feedback.

14
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,450
So in case there is
some issue with your code,

15
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,010
there's nobody to tell you that
you need to make these changes.

16
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:16,500
Also, if people are merging
directly into the master,

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,290
you will end up having way more conflicts.

18
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,780
So why create pull requests?

19
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,560
With pull requests, you
can invite other people

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,250
to review your work and give you feedback.

21
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,780
Once your changes have been approved,
your branch can be merged to master.

22
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,909
So without pull request,
you would jump right into

23
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:41,579
merging your feature
branch into the main branch.

24
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,379
However, with pull requests,

25
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:48,650
you will invite the reviewers to
provide feedback before merging.

26
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:52,510
Once they approve, it's ready
to be merged to the main branch.

27
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,459
Let's practice how to create pull
requests, how to merge a pull request,

28
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:02,370
and also see how to resolve
conflicts in the pull requests.

29
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,329
Let's go back to our
video course repository.

30
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,060
I want to create a new
feature branch for pull requests.

31
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:17,319
Let's say I create a new branch, git
checkout, minus b, feed pull request.

32
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,629
Now let's make some
changes to this branch.

33
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:34,599
Let's create a new file, file3.txt, and
add some changes, pull request, commit one.

34
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:49,099
Let's make the commit, git
commit minus m, commit one.

35
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:55,530
So now I want to merge this
branch to the main branch.

36
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:04,430
One way is that I go to the
main branch, git checkout, main,

37
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:10,569
and here I can do git
merge, feature pull request.

38
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:16,270
Now, this is risky, especially if
you're working in a project in a company,

39
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,689
So we never really run the merge
command directly into the CLI.

40
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:25,240
And most of the time it's also restricted.

41
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,979
So instead of merging
directly into the main,

42
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:32,659
what we will do is that we
will create a pull request.

43
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,479
Now how to create a pull request?

44
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,900
Let's go back to our feature
branch, get checkout, feature branch.

45
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:53,219
And here I will do git push because
first I need to push this branch to remote.

46
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,229
Now git tells me that this
branch does not exist on origin.

47
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,310
So I will need to run this command.

48
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:11,210
Okay, so now my branch is
pushed along with my changes,

49
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,800
and here I have the
link of the pull request.

50
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,639
So it says create a
pull request from feature

51
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,579
pull request on GitHub
by visiting this URL.

52
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,740
Let's copy this URL.

53
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:29,500
So this is a page where
we create a pull request.

54
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:34,439
Now there are different
conventions how to create a pull request.

55
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:42,480
Like for the title, it also should
start with your type of pull request.

56
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,980
So we can do like this feature.

57
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:51,810
This pull request is for
the feature pull requests

58
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,750
or learning to create pull requests.

59
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:00,449
Then you write the description.

60
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:07,240
In the title, you can also mention your
ticket ID, like which is this ticket,

61
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,000
and then write more description about it.

62
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,819
There is also a template for the
description, how to write good pull requests.

63
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:23,310
So one thing you would write is the
summary, like what is this pull request about?

64
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:29,750
Like for example, Learning pull requests.

65
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:35,879
What are the changes? So then you
can mention what are the changes.

66
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,699
Changes in file one.

67
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:48,209
Whenever you're working on a real
feature, often you have a couple of changes.

68
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,680
Like for example, if you're
working on a user login feature,

69
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,540
you will have a login screen. You will
have a couple of more things related to API.

70
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,500
So you can mention all the
changes in the changes section.

71
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,980
Then add the screenshots.

72
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:11,240
And add the relevant testing
strategy, how to test this feature.

73
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:15,589
And you can also write
additional notes in case

74
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:18,040
the reviewer needs to
know anything special.

75
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,670
Now, why do we create
pull requests like this?

76
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:27,790
It's because your pull requests are meant
to be reviewed by your other coworkers.

77
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:32,240
And if you provide nice
description about it, it's easier to review.

78
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,319
So now there's a button
to create pull requests.

79
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,110
Every platform has their own UI,

80
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:46,470
but all the platforms provide the
same functionality. Like for example,

81
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,850
you can add reviewers who
reviews this pull request.

82
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,800
Then you can also assign
the pull request to yourself.

83
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,420
You can provide labels, like for example,
if you're working on a frontend or a bug,

84
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,079
you can provide label as bug,
or if it is a frontend feature,

85
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:09,029
you can label it as
frontend or label it as backend.

86
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,649
So labels are really
helpful for the filtering.

87
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,980
Now let's click on create pull request.

88
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,810
So now it has created my pull
request, and you can see in the commits,

89
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,449
I can see which is the commit.

90
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,490
Also in the files
changed, I can see the changes.

91
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,750
So this is easier for the
reviewer to review your changes.

92
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:43,149
Your reviewer will most likely be
reviewing the changes in the files change section.

93
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,529
In case there are more files,

94
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:50,860
it will show more All the files
with the changes in all those files.

95
00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:04,370
So let's go back. And now what you
can do is you can merge the request.

96
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:10,110
Here you have a couple of options. You
can create a merge commit, simply merge.

97
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:14,889
I will use the first
one. So merge pull request.

98
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,110
Confirm merge.

99
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:32,059
Now, in order to verify whether the
changes are merged in the main branch,

100
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:34,429
let's go back to our main branch.

101
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:40,299
Let's go back to our editor, and
here I will move to the main branch.

102
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,980
Let's pull the changes.

103
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:51,110
And now you can see the
file tree is created,

104
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,759
and this has content
pull request commit one.

105
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:58,330
So we got the changes
related to pull requests.

106
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,009
So this is how you merge
by creating pull requests.

107
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:08,639
Let's also see how we can get
conflicts in our pull requests.

108
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,139
Now we know that in
order to get conflicts,

109
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:17,779
we need to have different content in
the same file in the two branches.

110
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,460
Let me create a new branch.

111
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:27,710
Get checkout minus B. Pull request.

112
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:31,210
Conflicts.

113
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,129
Let's change the file one.

114
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,100
Full request.

115
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,860
Let's make a commit,
git add all, git commit.

116
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,149
Conflicts, commit one.

117
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:04,730
Let's go back to our main.

118
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:09,889
Or let's make the changes
in main directly from the

119
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:13,870
GitHub so that we don't
have to push those changes.

120
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:20,230
I can just go to the
branch, and here I will create,

121
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:25,059
or I will change in the
file1.txt. Let's edit this file.

122
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,419
Changes from main.

123
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,559
Okay, let's commit these changes.

124
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,159
And now the point is that we have
changed file one in both the branches.

125
00:10:49,539 --> 00:10:52,509
So file one is
different in main branch and

126
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:55,149
file one is different
in our feature branch.

127
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:06,389
Now, in order to merge, I first will
Pushed my branch on GitHub. For that,

128
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:13,090
I need to run this command again. So
now there is a link, and let's go to it.

129
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,710
Open a merge request.

130
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:23,450
I'm not adding any particular template,
so we'll just add a normal description.

131
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,750
We are with conflicts.

132
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,899
Let's create the pull request.

133
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:42,480
Now in this case, it says that you had
tagged demo two and you changed with,

134
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,490
you replaced the content
with pull request changes one.

135
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,590
So it shows the changes in the files.

136
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:59,029
Okay, so now it clearly says that this
branch has conflicts that must be resolved.

137
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:03,320
Now you can resolve conflicts with GitHub,

138
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,929
but let's see how to do
it from the CLI itself.

139
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:11,399
So how I will resolve these changes.

140
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,529
The changes are first of all,

141
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:20,169
because both the branches have
different content in file1.txt.

142
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:28,710
So first, I need to go to
the main branch, git checkout

143
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,659
main, and pull the
changes, pull the latest changes.

144
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,139
So now I have the changes
which are made by another person.

145
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,899
I will go to the feature branch.

146
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:58,570
Now here, I can use the rebase
strategy, git checkout, Rebase main.

147
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:06,159
You can also use a merging strategy,
but I will be using git rebase here.

148
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:11,639
So once I do git rebase, it tells me
that which changes you want to keep.

149
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:14,340
I want to keep both
the changes, let's say.

150
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:24,129
So I will just add and do git
rebase hyphen hyphen continue.

151
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,289
And now I have the
changes from the main branch,

152
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:37,340
so I can push these changes because
now these conflicts have been resolved.

153
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:49,850
Because we used rebase, we will have
to use git push hyphen hyphen force.

154
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,809
Let's go back to our pull request.

155
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,889
And you can see there
are no conflicts now.

156
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:19,179
Let's see how we can resolve conflicts
using merge. So right now we used rebase.

157
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,149
So we pulled the latest changes of
main into our branch by using rebase,

158
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:27,470
but you can also use merge.

159
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,190
Let's see how to do that.

160
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:36,870
So first let, let me go
again and Change another file.

161
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,970
Let's say this time I change file two.

162
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:55,559
I will change the text and
now I have more changes.

163
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:02,139
So now file2.txt is
changed in the main branch.

164
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:06,809
I will change the same
file in our feature branch.

165
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:18,710
So let's go back to our repository and
change the file to pull request conflicts.

166
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:28,330
I will add the file, make the commit.

167
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:34,850
Commit to.

168
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,090
So in this commit, I have changed file to,

169
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:42,710
and I know the file to is
changed on the main branch.

170
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,940
First, let's push the
changes on our feature branch.

171
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,039
Let's go to the pull request.

172
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,899
So this is our pull request.

173
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:06,559
GitHub is evaluating that this branch
has conflicts that must be resolved.

174
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:12,909
You can also resolve it from here, but
let's see how to do it from the CLI.

175
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:16,889
Let's go back to our repository,

176
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:21,230
and this time I'm going to
merge the changes of main.

177
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,399
First of all, right now
when I do git merge main,

178
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:34,070
It will not bring the new
changes because my local main branch

179
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:38,019
does not have the updater
changes from the remote server.

180
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,379
So first I need to go
to my main branch and

181
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:44,960
update my main branch
with the new changes.

182
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:51,639
So I'll do git pull so that now my
local main branch has the updater changes.

183
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,129
Let's go back to the feature branch

184
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:09,450
Now, instead of doing now git
rebase main, I will do git merge main.

185
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:23,119
We have not moved to the feature
branch, so let's move to the feature branch.

186
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,140
Git checkout.

187
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,730
I have created aliases, which I
already taught in the previous section.

188
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,960
So this makes it easy to write commands.

189
00:17:40,819 --> 00:17:41,079
Okay.

190
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,720
So now in this case, I'm
going to do git merge main.

191
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,950
There are conflicts, of course,
that's why we need to resolve it.

192
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:56,269
And let's accept our
teammates changes this time.

193
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:04,329
Okay. So I have accepted
this change and do git add all,

194
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:08,160
and then git merge hyphen hyphen continue.

195
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:15,920
So whenever we are done with our
conflicts, we are, we have accepted the changes.

196
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:20,140
Then we need to run git add
all and git merge continue.

197
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,200
In this case, there is
going to be a merge commit.

198
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,049
So you can see there are changes.

199
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:36,500
There are changes from this
feature branch and there is additional

200
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,440
merge commit created because we
resolved the conflicts using merge.

201
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:46,339
Now let's do git push.

202
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:54,640
Let's go back to our pull request.

203
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,759
And now the conflicts have been resolved,
and you can click on Merge Pull Request,

204
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:06,140
and this will merge your pull request.

205
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,490
So this is how you create a pull request,

206
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:16,269
and this is how you resolve
conflicts in your pull request.

207
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:21,279
You can either use merge or you
can use rebase to resolve conflicts,

208
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:23,039
whichever works better for you.

209
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:27,960
When you will use rebase, there will
not be any additional merge commit.

210
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:30,640
However, the history would be different.

211
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,599
So you will often have to do
git push hyphen hyphen force.

212
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:40,490
So make your decision according to what
you think suits your scenario the best.
