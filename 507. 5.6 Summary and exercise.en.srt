00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,060
Let's recap what we
learned in this lesson.

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,109
So firstly, we talked about
branches, what are branches,

3
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:16,399
and how to work with
different types of branches,

4
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:18,589
like feature branch, bug fix branch.

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,390
We also discussed the concept of head.

6
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:25,429
We talked about that head
always refers to the latest

7
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:28,539
commit on the branch on which you are on.

8
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,699
If you switch the branches,

9
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:37,140
then head will represent the latest
commit on the newly switched branch.

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,750
We talked about some branch
commands, like how to create a branch,

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,340
how to delete a branch, and how to
switch between the different branches.

12
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:52,740
We talked about branching strategies,
mainly two types of branching strategies,

13
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,820
Git flow and GitHub flow.

14
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,140
Git flow is used in the
projects where releases are

15
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,659
less frequent, like
months, one or two months.

16
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,040
However, for website projects
where the releases are very frequent,

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,290
like once a day or two times a day,

18
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,629
you can use GitHub Flow because
that is more easier to manage.

19
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,140
We talked about what are
tags, why do we need tags,

20
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,530
and how to use them for releases.

21
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,930
We saw there were two types of
tags. One is the lightweight tag.

22
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,569
Another one is annotated
tags with more description.

23
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:37,189
Coming to the exercise now, You are asked
to develop user authentication feature,

24
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:39,790
follow all the steps which are required.

25
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:47,620
So first you need to create a
branch, use branch naming conventions,

26
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,189
create two files,
authentication.js, loginform.html, make a commit,

27
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:55,040
and also use conventional commits.

28
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:02,079
In the part two from the GitHub
UI, create a separate branch,

29
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,769
which should be a bug fix branch
in the authentication feature.

30
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:09,969
Use a proper branch name,

31
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:14,650
then make a commit and
cherry pick that bug fix commit

32
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,039
from that branch in your
authentication feature branch.
