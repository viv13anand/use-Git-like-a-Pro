1
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,990
Git checkout is a superpower command.

2
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,650
It can be used to do multiple things.

3
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:16,500
The first thing which you can do with
checkout command is switch branches.

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,199
So you can run git checkout and the
branch name where you want to move to.

5
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:25,050
Second thing which you
can do with the checkout

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,300
command is undo the changes in your file.

7
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:32,649
You need to do git checkout and the file
which you want to undo the changes in.

8
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,189
Third, which you can do with the git
checkout is moving to a commit or tag.

9
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:42,280
So you can do git
checkout and have a commit hash,

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,929
and it will move you to that commit.

11
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,270
Let's see how we can use checkout command.

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,250
Let's go to our file one, and I'm on
the same repository Git video course.

13
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,950
I will change this text to checkout demo.

14
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:10,329
Now if I do git status, it tells me
that you have modified file1.txt.

15
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,209
Let's run git diff.

16
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,629
Git diff tells me that
these were the changes before.

17
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,049
This is changes added from remote.

18
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,950
And now I have changed
the text to checkout demo.

19
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:30,079
Now, if I want to go back to my previous
changes, the one which I had committed,

20
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,019
I can use git checkout command.

21
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,629
I can do git checkout and the file.

22
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:42,790
So let's copy this file name because I
want to restore the changes of file1.txt.

23
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,140
And now you can see the changes are back.

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,420
You can also do the same from the
VS Code graphical user interface.

25
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,939
So let's make the changes again.

26
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,280
Let's say I've made
checkout demo changes again.

27
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,150
And now go to the source control tab.

28
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:08,900
In the VS Code source control tab,

29
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,259
you will see discard
changes in front of the file.

30
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:15,990
There is also an option to
discard all the changes.

31
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:19,560
So if you have multiple
changes, you can discard all of them.

32
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,189
But let's say I just want to discard
file1.txt, then I will just click on discard,

33
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:29,870
and this will restore my
changes to the previous commit.

34
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:37,090
Now, in case you have more files
changed, like let's change file1 again.

35
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:49,009
And also change commit demo
file to checkout demo file to.

36
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,349
So now I have changed two files.

37
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:59,400
And if I want to discard all of those
files, then I can do git checkout dot.

38
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,860
This will restore all of my
files to the previous version.

39
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:13,270
Similarly, you can do with the VS
Code. Just click on Discard All Changes.

40
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,250
So in the changes, you
can see there is an icon.

41
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,889
Just click on discard all changes, and
this will discard all of your files.

42
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:34,819
The second use of checkout
command can be to switch branches.

43
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:38,379
I know we have not talked
a lot about branches yet,

44
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:41,389
but we would be talking
about it in the next lesson.

45
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:46,000
So far, let's see how we can
switch branches using checkout command.

46
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:50,810
So let me create a branch
with git branch command.

47
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:54,569
Let's call it feature checkout.

48
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,180
Now if I want to move to this
branch, first let's see The git status.

49
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,770
In git status, it says
you are on branch main,

50
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,110
and I want to move to
feature checkout branch.

51
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:19,470
So I can do git
checkout, feed slash checkout.

52
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,269
And now it says you have
switched to branch feed slash checkout.

53
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,100
You can verify it with the
git status command again,

54
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,459
and it tells you you are on this branch.

55
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,470
So we have seen how we can
use git checkout to restore

56
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,639
our files and also how to
switch between branches.

57
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:42,350
Third thing that we talked
about is moving to commits.

58
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:46,529
So let's first see the history of
our commits with git log command.

59
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,420
Now let's see I want to move
to the second last commit.

60
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,839
So first I'll copy this hash.

61
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:00,949
And then with the checkout command, I
can use git checkout and the commit hash.

62
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:04,560
We don't need the author,
so just remove this one.

63
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:09,610
So now we have moved to
the particular commit

64
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,689
and it says you are in
a detached head state.

65
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,110
This means that you
don't belong to any branch.

66
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:19,600
And if you want to make any changes,

67
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,139
the ideal
recommendation is that you create

68
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:25,040
a branch from this
commit using get branch.

69
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,389
Check out demo two.

70
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:44,339
And I also want to move to this branch.

71
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,879
And if I check the git log,

72
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:57,819
We are on the third last commit,
from where we cut this branch.

73
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:02,779
So all you need to remember is that
whenever you are moving to a commit,

74
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,829
you will be in a detached head state.

75
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:09,350
And if you want to make more
changes on top of that commit,

76
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,910
you need to create branches.

77
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,839
Don't worry if you don't understand
the branches and everything right now.

78
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,480
We'll get to it in the later part.
