1
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,470
Let's dive deeper into commits.

2
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,109
So what is a commit?

3
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:13,970
Commit is basically the
snapshot of the project taken by Git.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,140
So whenever you're working on a project,
you are making any changes to the files,

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,109
you will add them to the staging
area. And when you say Git commit,

6
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:28,239
what Git does is that it
will take snapshot of the exact

7
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,030
state of the project and put
it to your local repository.

8
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,579
Snapshots are always
committed to your local repository.

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,189
If you want your commits to be
pushed to the remote repository,

10
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:43,890
then you have to use git push command.

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,259
Now, how can we create perfect commits?

12
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:50,590
Or I would say better commits.

13
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:54,350
So rule number one is
creating granular commits.

14
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,020
Let's say you were working
on a bunch of files. Now,

15
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,689
one way is that you add
everything inside a single commit,

16
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:04,680
but that is not good because in case there

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,010
is any bug or you need
to make any changes,

18
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,680
you will have to revert all the changes.

19
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,400
So instead, what you can do is
that you can create smaller commits.

20
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,319
Smaller commits has a bunch of benefits.

21
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,890
For example, it's easier
to review the changes.

22
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:28,519
Also, if there is any mistake
or any bug in one of the commit,

23
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:33,079
it's easy to roll back that commit
without changing the rest of the commits.

24
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:40,060
So creating granular commits is better
than creating a single large commit.

25
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,439
Now, when I say creating granular commits,

26
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,090
I don't mean that you create a
single commit for each file,

27
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,140
but let's say you are working on
a big feature like user login.

28
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:58,299
And now user login has a login
screen. It has authentication.

29
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,939
It has some backend API integrations.

30
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:06,060
So instead of doing all
the work in a single commit,

31
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,139
what you can do is that you can break
down the functionality into multiple commits,

32
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:17,819
like you can have UI changes in one
commit, testing changes in another commit,

33
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:21,060
and then backend
integrations in a separate commit.

34
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:28,870
You can leverage the staging area
for creating those smaller commits.

35
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,740
So basically, if you
have made all the changes,

36
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,490
but you want to break it
down into three commits,

37
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:42,479
so you can start by adding the commits
into the staging area for only that commit.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,090
So you can push only your
stage changes into one commit,

39
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:52,659
and then add more to your staging
area and add it to the second commit.

40
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:56,960
Another important thing
in creating good commits

41
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,400
is writing a valuable commit message.

42
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,900
So commit message is
really important because this

43
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,349
gives you basically idea
about what the commit is.

44
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:10,229
And if your teammates are
also reviewing the commits,

45
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:14,240
it's easier for them to
understand what this commit is about.

46
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:18,780
So the good commit
message should have a brief and

47
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,240
concise subject line that
summarizes the changes.

48
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:27,270
It can have a descriptive message body
that explain most of the important facts.

49
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:32,330
And what you can also do is
leverage conventional commits.

50
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,590
I will talk more about
conventional commits in the later sections.
