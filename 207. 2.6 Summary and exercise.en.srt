00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:11,310
Let's recap what we learned in this
lesson. So we talked about Git workflow,

2
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:17,329
in which we saw that your code lives in
four areas throughout the Git workflow,

3
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:21,750
which is your local directory, your
staging area, your local repository,

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,350
and your remote repository.

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,980
Second, we talked about adding and
committing files to get repository.

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,829
We also saw how to do
commit and adding files

7
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:36,530
using VS code graphical user interface.

8
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,369
Then we saw some more git commands,

9
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:41,929
which is git log to check
the history of commits.

10
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:45,060
We also saw git fetch and git pull.

11
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,380
We also checked what is the
difference between git pull and git fetch.

12
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:57,020
Then finally, we saw how
we can create Git aliases,

13
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,420
which can help us running
those commands faster. Basically,

14
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,469
you can configure it in your Git config,

15
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:10,569
or you can also add it to your ZSH
RC and use aliases for the commands.

16
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:15,019
Moving on to the exercise.

17
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:20,329
So part one is practice all the
commands that we learned in this lesson.

18
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:26,819
So try git status, git add, git log,
git commit, git fetch, and git pull.

19
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,849
Also, try it using VS Code.

20
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,530
Try all the commands.
Try to see how you can

21
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,409
use leverage VS Code to
run all these things.

22
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:41,129
Part two is add
aliases for these commands.

23
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,090
I would highly encourage
you to add the aliases and

24
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,379
use aliases because when
you are working every day,

25
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:50,209
the aliases are really helpful.

26
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:52,870
Thank you and see you in the next lesson.
