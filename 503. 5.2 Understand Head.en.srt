1
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:09,439
As you work more and
more with the branches,

2
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,410
you will see a term
showing up often during commits.

3
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:14,130
This term is head.

4
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,730
When you do git log,
you will see something

5
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,879
like the commit hash and also head master.

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,140
So far, we have seen head pointing to the
most recent commit in the master branch.

7
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,780
However, head is simply
a reference to a commit.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,880
It can refer to any commit in any branch.

9
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:40,619
So when you do git
checkout your feature branch,

10
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:45,060
head would be pointing to the most
recent commit in your feature branch.

11
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:50,399
So let's say first I
was on the master branch.

12
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:56,439
My head would be pointing to the latest
commit on the master branch, which is C3.

13
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:01,939
Now let's say I created a feature
branch and made some commits on it.

14
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,530
So now my feature
branch is pointing to C6.

15
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:10,290
And if I do git checkout feature branch,

16
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,599
the head would be pointing to the latest
commit on feature branch, which is C6.

17
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:20,230
You can always switch back
head to some other branch.

18
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:27,120
Basically, if we do git checkout master
again, the head would be pointing to C3.

19
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,239
So why do we need head?

20
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,730
You can think of head as a name to
the most recent commit on your branch.

21
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:39,109
You can use head in your
commands like get reset,

22
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:42,450
where you want to reset
to the nth last commit.

23
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:45,989
And also you can use head in the commands,

24
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:49,709
in any command in which you
want to refer to the commits.

25
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,040
Let's see how that looks in the practice.

26
00:01:54,689 --> 00:02:03,909
So let's go back to our repo and make
changes again, get our head demo one.

27
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:15,409
Let's make bunch of commits, get
commit minus am head demo one.

28
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:27,439
Let's make another commit, head
demo two and head demo three.

29
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:32,330
Let's check the Git log.

30
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:39,669
And now what I want to do is I want
to reset to my branch demo commit.

31
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,699
So basically I want to remove all
the three commits which I made.

32
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:48,120
One way we were doing it
was by copying the hash

33
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,590
of the commit where we want to reset back.

34
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:53,650
But instead of using this hash,

35
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:59,500
what we can tell Git is that we
want to delete The last three commits.

36
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:05,500
So basically, from the topmost
commit, we want to go three commits before.

37
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,409
So we say git reset.

38
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,120
Head, from the latest
commit, go three commits before.

39
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:29,479
And now if we do git log, you can see
all the three commits were removed.

40
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:36,729
So this is one way how you can
use head to go back to the commits,

41
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:40,180
because with the head, you can
always tell how many commits

42
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,310
before the last commit
you want to go back to.

43
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:51,180
Similarly for restoring files,
let's make those commits again.

44
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,340
Let's commit it, git add all, git commit.

45
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,800
Head demo one.

46
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:13,629
Let's make another commit.

47
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,879
Minus AM, head demo two.

48
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:32,970
Now in the Git log, I have two commits.

49
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:40,860
I want to restore the file to the
changes in the second last commit.

50
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,199
So, or let's say third last commit.

51
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:49,149
So I want to restore this
file's changes to the changes

52
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:51,740
which were there in the third last commit.

53
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,449
So what I can do is instead
of copying the hash again,

54
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:58,170
I'm going to play with the head.

55
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,959
So we saw we can use git
restore command to do it.

56
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,259
So git restore.

57
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:10,550
What's the source of the
file? So the source is head.

58
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:14,750
Go to commits before head.

59
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:18,540
And name of the file, which is file1.txt.

60
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:26,899
So we are back on the branch demo.

61
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:33,139
So this restored the file to the
commit to the second last commit version.

62
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:38,129
So this is how you can play with the head
whenever you want to refer to the commits.
