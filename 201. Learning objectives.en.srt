Welcome to lesson two, working with Git.

2
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:12,240
In this lesson, we dive deeper
into the practical use of Git.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,539
We are going to focus on some
basic Git commands and learn

4
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:19,870
to use them from both
command line and through VS Code.

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,070
We start off by
understanding Git usage and workflow.

6
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,980
We explore how to add and
commit changes to a Git repository.

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,799
You are introduced to the Git
log, Git fetch, Git pull commands.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,030
Additionally, we look into Git aliases,

9
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,140
which help you to create
shortcuts for frequently used commands.

10
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,130
Finally, we recap what we have
learned and run through an exercise.

11
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,450
Well, that's the plan for
this lesson. Let's get started.
