00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,890
Let's recap the differences
between merging and rebase.

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:15,099
So we saw that with merging,
it's going to be a three-way merge,

3
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:18,929
which means Git is going to
create an additional merge commit.

4
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,269
However, with rebasing,
no merge commit is created

5
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:27,339
because it's always a fast-forward merge.

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,699
Now, whether to use merge or rebase,

7
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:33,840
it depends on your
personal preference or also on

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,320
what you have decided as
a team in your project.

9
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:42,649
Some people like to see the
cleaner history, so they prefer rebase.

10
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:49,149
However, there are different benefits of
using merge, so some people prefer merging.

11
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,960
The major benefit of rebasing is that
you get a much cleaner project history.

12
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:59,380
There are no unnecessary merge
commits required by git merge.

13
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,519
So git rebase creates a linear
history which makes it easy to

14
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,989
navigate the project with git
log or git bisect commands.

15
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:13,959
However, there are also some
pitfalls using git rebase.

16
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,049
Since git rebase rewrites the history,

17
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:21,859
it can be dangerous in
terms of collaboration if

18
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:25,239
you don't follow the
golden rules of rebasing.

19
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:31,989
The first rule we have is that you
never use git rebase on public branches,

20
00:01:31,989 --> 00:01:37,299
which means you never do git checkout
master and do git rebase feature branch.

21
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:39,579
Why is that?

22
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,280
Because your master branch
has hundreds of commits,

23
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,480
and a lot of other people are
also working on the master branch.

24
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:52,290
Now, when you do git
rebase feature branch,

25
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,040
what it will do is that it
will take all the commits of the

26
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,769
master branch and put it on
top of your feature branch.

27
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:07,060
And the problem with that is that
it only happen in your repository.

28
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,960
All the developers who are still
working on the original main branch,

29
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,319
they will have a very different history.

30
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:19,210
Since Rebase results in brand new commits,

31
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,479
Git will think that
your main branch history

32
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,930
has diverged from
everybody else's history.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,500
Also, when you try to push the
master to remote with git push master,

34
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,400
git will prevent you from doing so
because it conflicts with the remote main branch.

35
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:41,550
If you did git push
master hyphen hyphen force,

36
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:46,490
it will override the remote master with
your rebase branch, which is not good.

37
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:52,250
So the second rule is that before you
run git rebase, always ask yourself,

38
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,650
is anyone else looking at that branch?

39
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,490
So for example, with the main branch,

40
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,009
because other people are also
working on the main branch,

41
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:04,830
don't do git rebase on the main branch.

42
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,810
Also, with the feature branches,

43
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,439
if you think couple of more people
are working on the same feature branch,

44
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:15,419
then don't do git rebase
in that feature branch.

45
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,830
Only do the git rebase in the
branches where you are working on,

46
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,539
and you know that the rebase is
going to be safer in that case.
