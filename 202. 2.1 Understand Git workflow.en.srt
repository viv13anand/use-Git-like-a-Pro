1
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,900
So in Git, there are four
areas where your code lives.

2
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:13,000
The first one is your
local working directory.

3
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:16,620
This is the place where you
make changes to your files.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,300
So this is your coding editor, like
VS Code or whichever you are using.

5
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:24,179
Second place is the staging area.

6
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:28,660
This is a special area where
you keep your finalized changes.

7
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:32,539
So you basically tell Git
that these are the finalized

8
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:34,770
changes which are ready to be committed.

9
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:38,450
Third area is local repository.

10
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:41,729
So this is the place
in your local computer.

11
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:45,399
This is your local .git
folder in your project.

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,740
And the last one is the remote repository.

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,009
So this is the .git folder in the
remote server, which is the GitHub.

14
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,140
So talking about how
the workflow looks like.

15
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,049
So whenever you are
starting with any project,

16
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:04,189
you would basically
cloning a remote repository.

17
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,209
You would use the git clone command,

18
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:10,450
and that will download that
repository to your local machine.

19
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,709
After that, you will start to
make changes in your files.

20
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:21,319
And once you are working on it,
making changes, and you want to commit it,

21
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:23,299
you would be doing git add.

22
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:28,319
Add them to the staging areas, all the
changes which you have made to the files.

23
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,560
And then you would be
committing it to your local repository.

24
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,930
So all the changes in the staging area
will go to the local repository after commit.

25
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:41,709
You will run git commit command,

26
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:45,090
and it will commit the
changes to the local repository.

27
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,950
But right now, it's only
on your local machine.

28
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:52,840
In order to push it, push
your changes to the remote,

29
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,879
you will use the kit push command.

30
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,090
Sometimes you also need to
integrate your teammates work.

31
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:01,769
Let's say your teammate
is also working on the

32
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:04,200
same project and he or
she has some changes.

33
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,120
Now you also want to
integrate his or her changes.

34
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,280
So you can use get pull
command and that will bring

35
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,330
all the changes which
are made to the repository

36
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,460
by your peers or your
coworkers that will be

37
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,550
integrated to your
local working directory.

38
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,219
Instead of pull, you can
also use git fetch command.

39
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,419
It is a little bit
different than git pull command.

40
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:33,039
We will talk about it in
the later section as well.

41
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,199
But basically, if you are using git fetch,

42
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:40,150
what git fetch will do is
that it will copy the .git

43
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,789
folder from remote repo
to your local repository.

44
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:47,599
But the changes will not
come to your working directory.

45
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,520
Which means that Git will be
aware that there are some changes,

46
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,219
but if you want to integrate
it to your working directory,

47
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:58,569
you need to run git merge command.

48
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:04,599
So git pull is a shortcut. It's like git
pull is equal to git fetch plus git merge.

49
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:09,310
Let's practice this
workflow and see how this looks.

50
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:16,180
So we already have a repository like Git
Video Course. I'm just going to clone it.

51
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,219
So just copy it and let's say git clone.

52
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,849
Now I've cloned the repository.

53
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:29,150
I can go to get video course folder.

54
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,879
And open it in my coding editor.

55
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,509
So there are already some files here.

56
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,449
I can just change some
text in the file one.

57
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,189
So this is my...

58
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,819
Changes for git workflow.

59
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,900
Let's create another
file as well, file2.txt.

60
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,319
Practice git workflow.

61
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,290
Now, if you want to see what
all changes you have made,

62
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,399
you can also run the status command,

63
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,319
and you can see the git
tells you that you have one file

64
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,850
which is modified and another file
which is a new file, which is file two.

65
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:31,800
We can also see the changes
from the Visual Studio Code.

66
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:38,680
So if you just Go to
the source control. Yeah.

67
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,379
So in the source control tab, just
click on the source control. And here,

68
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:48,189
if you just click on any of the
file, it will show you your changes.

69
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,060
So these are the changes which I made,

70
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,370
and these were the changes
which were already in the remote.

71
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:59,500
And in the file too, we
have all new changes.

72
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,329
So it tells you that
you have added this file.

73
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,060
So the green ones are the
changes which you added and the red

74
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,920
ones are the changes which
were already there from the,

75
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,629
which are coming from the remote.

76
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:14,810
Okay. So now we have made the changes.

77
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,670
Now we can use git add command.

78
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:24,430
And what git add command does is that it
adds your changes to the staging area.

79
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,639
Now you can add all the
files to the staging area,

80
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,670
but you can also select some
files for the staging area.

81
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,680
So let's say I only want to add
file1.txt in the staging area.

82
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:44,300
So I can do git add and file1.txt,

83
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:51,230
and that will only add my
file1.txt into the staging area.

84
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:57,980
So this means that when I do git
commit, only file1.txt will be committed.

85
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:03,220
The file2.ext will not be
committed because it is not staged.

86
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:08,360
So all the changes that you want
to commit to your local repository,

87
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,860
you first need to add
them to the staging area.

88
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,990
This staging area is really helpful. For
example, you're working on a big feature,

89
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:23,529
you made a lot of changes, but you want
to break those changes in smaller commits.

90
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,180
So it's possible that you
say that only a certain number

91
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,399
of changes are the changes
for the particular commit.

92
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,550
The rest of the changes are maybe
some drafts or they are not finalized.

93
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:40,689
So this staging area is really helpful
when you are working with a lot of files.

94
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:52,040
So let's now commit it. For
committing, we can use git commit minus m.

95
00:06:52,040 --> 00:07:00,019
Minus m is for the message, and
here we can write staging area demo.

96
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:07,750
Now we have committed, and
if we run git status command,

97
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:15,019
so you can see that this file was not
sent to your commit. Now if I do git push,

98
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:17,639
it will push the changes
to the remote repository,

99
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,959
but it will not include the file 2.txt.

100
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,850
Now next thing is, let's push our changes.

101
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:37,339
Let's also push the
another file. So get status,

102
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:40,569
right now we have file
two, which is not added.

103
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,350
So let's also add it.

104
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,459
You can also add multiple files
together, and if you want to add all the files,

105
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:50,139
then you can use simply dot.

106
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,930
So if I had like more files,
file 3, 4, 5, if I did git add dot,

107
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,699
it will add all the
files to the staging area.

108
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,800
So let's add that and also do git commit.

109
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,689
Minus M, more changes.

110
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:16,759
And now I have two commits, so I
will just push these changes. Okay.

111
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,290
Now we can check.

112
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,310
On our remote repository, so the file
one, these are my changes from Git workflow,

113
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,649
so I already made changes to the
files which are reflecting here,

114
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:36,279
and then I also changed
file to practice Git workflow.

115
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:40,240
So we have the changes which are
pushed to the remote repository.

116
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:45,919
Now let's say your teammate made
some changes to this repository.

117
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:51,909
So let's create a file here.

118
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:56,129
Let's call it file3.txt.

119
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,750
More changes into the repository.

120
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,120
Yeah, just committed.

121
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,379
Now there are changes in this
repository, but in the local repository,

122
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:16,889
the file three does not exist.

123
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:19,860
So let's go back to our local repository.

124
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:27,789
And right now, you can see in the git
status, Yeah, there is nothing to commit.

125
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:33,309
We have committed all our changes, but
right now there is no, uh, file three.

126
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:36,960
Right. But on our remote,
there is file three as well.

127
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,860
So we want to
integrate the remote changes.

128
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,000
So for that, we can do get pull.

129
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:49,700
And now we have file three.

130
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,759
So this is how you will integrate your
teammates work in your local computer.

131
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:01,190
So all the new changes which
are in the remote repository,

132
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:06,220
you can integrate it to your local
repository by using git pull command.

133
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,000
Let's see what would have
happened if I used git fetch.

134
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:26,250
Let's add a new file,
file4.txt, testing git fetch.

135
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:33,029
So now instead of git
pull, I will use git fetch.

136
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,970
So here I do git fetch.

137
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:43,429
Now, I used git fetch, but
there is no file four here.

138
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:52,179
So this file four was not created in my
local repository, but if you do git status,

139
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:58,309
it says that your branch is
behind the origin main by one commit.

140
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,990
Origin main is the remote repo,

141
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,409
so you are behind it
because there is one commit

142
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:09,049
additional which includes the file for,

143
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:13,470
but my local repository does
not know anything about it.

144
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:20,970
So if we want to integrate those
changes, now we can do git merge.

145
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:26,269
If we do git merge, we
will get the same file for.

146
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:30,779
So we have integrated these
changes to our local repository.

147
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,320
Git pull is a
shortcut. If you do git pull,

148
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,500
you directly pull the changes
from the remote to your local.

149
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:42,080
If you use git fetch, then
you can review those changes.

150
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,480
If you want to merge it
to your local repository,

151
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,700
you need to additionally
use git merge command.
