1
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:11,539
So far, we saw in order to
integrate our feature changes into master,

2
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:16,309
we can check out to master branch
and do git merge feature branch.

3
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:23,649
We also saw that merging also creates
additional merge commit to complete the merge.

4
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,500
However, as an alternative to merging,

5
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,239
you can use rebase to
merge the feature branch

6
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,729
into main using the following commands.

7
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,189
In this case, you will first
check out to your feature branch,

8
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:40,850
then do git rebase master.

9
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:44,429
Let's understand this
better using an example.

10
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:50,579
Let's say we are on master branch, and
master branch is pointing to commit C1.

11
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,310
Now we want to work on our feature branch,

12
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,560
so we will create a
feature branch from C1,

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,530
and we'll switch to this feature
branch, and create more commits.

14
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:09,810
So now our feature branch is on C3,
whereas our master branch is on C1.

15
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,569
Now we made two more
commits to the master branch.

16
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,010
So now master branch is
pointing to commit C5.

17
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:25,349
If I want to merge my
feature branch into master branch,

18
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:32,099
one way is that I can go to the master
branch and do git merge feature branch.

19
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,909
In this case, git will create a merge
commit because this is a three-way merge.

20
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:43,290
Alternatively, what you can do is
that you can go to your feature branch,

21
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,030
git checkout feature branch,
and then run git rebase master.

22
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,890
What rebase will do is that it will
take master branch changes, which is,

23
00:01:53,890 --> 00:02:00,280
in this case, is C4 and C5, and put
feature branch commits on top of it.

24
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:09,319
So in this case, with rebase, Git
will put C2 and C3 on top of C4 and C5.

25
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,139
To recap, when we do git checkout
feature branch and git rebase main,

26
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:24,210
This moves the entire feature branch
to begin on the tip of master branch,

27
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,099
effectively incorporating all
the new commits in the master.

28
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,599
Now, when we go to the master
and do git merge feature branch,

29
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,840
it will be a fast forward merge
because there were no more commits

30
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,750
in the master when we were
trying to merge the feature branch.

31
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:47,969
And now we don't have additional
merge commit also in the history.

32
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,120
This makes Git history
cleaner and easier to view.
