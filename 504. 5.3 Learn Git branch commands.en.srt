1
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:09,080
Let's look at the commands of git branch.

2
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:13,849
So first command we have is to list
all the branches, which is git branch.

3
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:16,480
It tells you all the branches you have.

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,269
Next, we have git branch branch name,

5
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:24,339
which we have already seen
in the previous sections.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,839
This command creates a new branch.

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:34,039
Then we have checkout or switch branch
command to switch to an existing branch.

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,390
You can either use git
checkout branch name,

9
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:41,219
or you can use git switch
to switch to another branch.

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,880
For creating a new branch and
switching to it immediately,

11
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,890
you can use git checkout
minus b and branch name.

12
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:55,689
In order to delete a branch,

13
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:59,969
you can use git branch hyphen
capital D along with the branch name.

14
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:03,530
Let's practice all these commands.

15
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:06,319
Let's move back to our repo.

16
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,079
So right now we are on main branch.

17
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:16,030
We have some changes. I will
just remove those changes.

18
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,219
I'm using git checkout command.

19
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:24,390
You can also use git restore command
to get rid of the changes you have.

20
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:29,769
So now I have no more changes.

21
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:38,799
So first of all, let's use git branch
command to see which all branches we have.

22
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,689
So I do have feed checkout and feed
user login, all of these branches.

23
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:52,439
In order to create a new branch,

24
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,250
we can simply do git branch
and the name branch-demo.

25
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,659
To verify if this branch was
successfully created or not,

26
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:09,610
you can run the git branch command
again, and it says feature branch demo,

27
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,150
so we already see the
branch which we have created.

28
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:20,389
So if I now want to move to this
feature branch, feature branch demo,

29
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:25,969
I will need to run git
checkout, the branch name.

30
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:36,919
Now if I run git status, it tells me
I'm on branch feature, branch demo.

31
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,360
So right now I had to run two commands.

32
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,810
So basically I created
a new branch and then

33
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,729
I run git checkout to move to that branch.

34
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,430
So we have a shortcut to do
both steps in one command.

35
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:57,360
Let's go back to the main branch.

36
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,189
Let's create another
branch and move to it.

37
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:11,439
So what we can write here is git
checkout minus b, the new branch name.

38
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:16,530
Branch demo two.

39
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:22,629
So what this command will do is
that it will create this branch,

40
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:26,439
feature branch demo two, and
also switches to this branch.

41
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,939
So now if I run this command,

42
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:34,000
it says switch to a new
branch feed slash branch demo two.

43
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:38,300
So this is a very handy,
so usually I personally run

44
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,150
this command whenever I
have to create a new branch.

45
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,840
And most of the time I
want to move to that branch

46
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,810
because I want to work on that branch.

47
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:51,550
Let's move back to the master branch.

48
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,789
Instead of checkout,
you can also use switch.

49
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:01,020
Switch domain.

50
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:08,659
Now let's say I want to
delete Couple of branches.

51
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,379
So what I will do is first I want
to list all the branches I have.

52
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,759
Let's say I want to
delete feed checkout demo too.

53
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:27,110
So I'll just copy it and do
git branch-t the branch name.

54
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,399
And now it tells me that you have
deleted branch checkout demo two.

55
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,899
If I want to delete
multiple branches together,

56
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,220
I can type all the branch names
together. So let's copy two branches.

57
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,060
Let's delete branch
demo and branch demo two.

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,149
So let's copy this and run the same
command with minus D, git branch minus D.

59
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,480
Name of the branches separated by space.

60
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:10,220
Now it says that you have deleted
branch demo and branch demo two.
