1
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:10,009
We are going to practice more on
adding and committing the files.

2
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,949
So what we are going to do in this
section is basically create a new repository.

3
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,149
Then we'll create new files,
change some existing files,

4
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:24,899
and add files to the staging area. And
finally, we make commit to the repository.

5
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:29,820
I would be using Visual Studio
Code, so use any text editor you want.

6
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:32,460
So let's practice.

7
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:40,530
Let's start with creating a
directory. Let's say git commit demo.

8
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:49,740
Let's move to this git commit demo
and open it in the coding editor.

9
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,579
Okay, right now it's an empty
project. It's not a git repository.

10
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,689
And how do we know
it's not a git repository

11
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:00,549
is because if I do ls,
there's nothing in it.

12
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:06,219
In order to make it a Git
repository, we need to do git init.

13
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,680
Now, one thing I want you to
notice here is that as I did get in it,

14
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,129
there is some message
in the yellow that using

15
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:21,200
master as the name of the initial branch,

16
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,269
this default branch
name is subject to change.

17
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:30,519
So basically, by default, Git has
initialized the branch as master.

18
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,620
And if you do git status, it will
tell you that you are on branch master.

19
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:41,519
However, on GitHub, main is
used as the default branch,

20
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:47,469
so it will often ask you to
change the master branch name to main.

21
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,859
It depends on project to project.

22
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,579
Some projects use trunk, some projects
use develop, some projects use master.

23
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:00,370
So it's really based on the project.

24
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,650
We would be working mainly with the main.

25
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,030
So I will rename it to main.

26
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:10,610
There is another way
which you can also change

27
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,699
your default branch
name from master to main.

28
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,120
So it says that if you want to
change your default branch name,

29
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,580
you can simply add it to the config.

30
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,349
So that the next time
when you do git init,

31
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:27,099
it will initialize it
as main and not master.

32
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:31,090
So let's see what happens if I run this.

33
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:38,460
So git config Just copy it again.

34
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,159
Git config in a default
branch, and here, if I

35
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,159
want to change it to
main, I will type main.

36
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:51,449
If you want to change it to trunk, you
can type here trunk, but let's stick to main.

37
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,310
So now it has changed the
default branch name to main,

38
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:06,500
but this is for the next time. So
next time, whenever you do git init,

39
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,159
it will change it to, it will
initialize it with main, but for now,

40
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,150
it has already initialized with master.

41
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:19,860
So one thing we can do is in order to
change this branch, we can run a command.

42
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,870
So Git already tells us that you can
run this command, git branch minus m,

43
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,150
and it will change the
default branch name.

44
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:36,099
So let's run this command, git branch
minus m, and I want to change it to main,

45
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:42,550
so I will just type main, and
now, now if I do git status,

46
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:47,620
it tells you on branch
main, there are no commits yet.

47
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,000
But yeah, the branch name is main.

48
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,509
How else you can tell that
you have... This is a Git repo.

49
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:00,699
It's also... You can check
ls-a, and there is a .git folder,

50
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:05,110
so it's a Git repository, and
also Git status is working,

51
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,319
so you know that the
depository has been...

52
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:10,159
Initialize properly.

53
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:16,870
Now we already have the Git
repository. Let's add some more files.

54
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:21,629
Let's add file1.txt.

55
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,680
This is commit demo1.

56
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,680
Demo file 1.

57
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,899
Let's add two more files.

58
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:45,310
File 2.txt, file 3.txt, and
I will just... This is...

59
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,509
Commit demo file 2.

60
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:55,740
Let's copy, and in the file 3,
so I've created three new files.

61
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:04,990
Now if I do git status, it is
showing me three untracked files.

62
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,529
Now, in order to commit it, I first
need to add them to my staging area.

63
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,129
So let's add git add.

64
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,850
Let's say I just want to
add file one and file two.

65
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:24,819
So just copy the name
file one and file two.

66
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:25,639
If I...

67
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,579
Add it here.

68
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,779
So now if we check git status.

69
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:35,990
So in the git status, we have
two files in the staging area.

70
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,829
So these are changes to be committed.

71
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:46,040
If you also want to add
file 3, do git add file3.txt.

72
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:57,889
And now if we do git status, we have
three files which are staged to be committed.

73
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:02,649
In order to commit it, we
need to run the commit command,

74
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:04,500
which is git commit minus m.

75
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:11,470
Commit demo, and yeah.

76
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:17,269
So now the files, now the commit
is there, so we have made a commit.

77
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:22,939
Here, let's see how we
can do these things,

78
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:28,350
how we can commit and add files
using VS Code graphical user interface.

79
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:35,079
So let's say I want to
change some files. So let's say,

80
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:37,019
let's change the text of file1.ext.

81
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,449
This is using VS code.

82
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:53,370
So now in this source control
tab, just click on source control,

83
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:59,060
and this will tell you that these
are the changes. If you click on it,

84
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,720
you will see what changes are there.

85
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,110
And if you need to add it to the
staging area, just click on plus icon.

86
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:13,480
This will add the changes into the
staged area. It's very simple using VS code.

87
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,420
So you can also Instead of command line,
you can use Visual Studio Code interface.

88
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:23,519
In order to unstage, you can
also use the minus sign here,

89
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:25,370
so it will unstage the changes.

90
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:39,100
Let me also make some more changes
using VS Code, and here also using VS Code.

91
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:44,779
Let's go to the source control tab again.

92
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,959
And you can also add
all the changes together,

93
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:57,220
like using this plus icon in front of
the changes. So if you click on plus,

94
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,870
it says stage all changes.

95
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:03,110
So if you click on plus, this
will stage all the changes.

96
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,990
If you want to verify, you
can verify using its status,

97
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,160
and all the changes are
there to be committed.

98
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:19,100
In order to unstage, unstage all
changes, click on Minus, and then Get Status.

99
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:22,079
The changes are unstaged.

100
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:28,410
Let's add all of them and
make a commit using VS Code.

101
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:31,269
So first, stage all the changes.

102
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,529
Commit using VS code.

103
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:45,000
So now it's, just click
on commit and that's done.

104
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,289
Now if I do get status, yeah.

105
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:59,169
We can see if the, Commit is made
or not. So we have the commit here.

106
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:05,309
So we will talk about git log command in
the next section only. So with git log,

107
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:06,600
you can view your commit.

108
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,279
So we can see all the
commits that we made are here.

109
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:17,159
So this is how you can Make add
changes to your staging area, make a commit,

110
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:21,279
and also do the same using VS
Code graphical user interface.
