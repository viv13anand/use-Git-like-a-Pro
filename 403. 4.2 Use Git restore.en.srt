1
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:11,779
Git restore command is used to restore a
file to its previously committed state.

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,560
You can use git restore and the file name.

3
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:18,640
It is very similar to what we
did with the git checkout command.

4
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:21,089
So we were running git
checkout, file name,

5
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:23,550
and it would restore it
to its previous version.

6
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:29,629
But instead of git checkout, you can also
use git restore command to do the same.

7
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:36,740
Just make sure whenever you run git
restore command for restoring your file changes,

8
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,200
the changes will be permanently lost.

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,450
And this also happens
with the checkout command.

10
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:45,950
You will lose the
changes if you restore it.

11
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,670
We can also restore a file
to any commit in the log.

12
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:54,100
We need to tell number of
commits we need to go back to.

13
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,359
So you can run command
git restore hyphen hyphen

14
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:01,200
source head tilde n file underscore name.

15
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,890
N here refers to the number of
commits prior to head we want to go back.

16
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:12,079
We can also use git
restore to unstage the files

17
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:14,769
added to the staging area using git add.

18
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:20,719
In order to do that, just run git
restore hyphen hyphen staged file name.

19
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:23,900
Let's see all of this in practice.

20
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:29,760
So we would be practicing git restore
file name to restore the changes in the file.

21
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:33,519
Then we would be
restoring to the previous commit.

22
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,290
And then finally, we'll try
restoring the staged files.

23
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,939
So let's go back to the file1.txt again,

24
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:49,469
and let's say here I have
written git restore demo1.

25
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:56,439
Now here, you can also do git
checkout file1.txt, and this works perfect.

26
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:04,400
But instead, you can also do git
restore and the file name, file1.txt.

27
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,219
And now the changes are back.

28
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,060
One interesting thing with git
restore is that you can move

29
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,129
to the version of this file
to previous commits as well.

30
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:23,990
Like for example, let me
change this back and commit it.

31
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:34,840
Git add all, git commit, restore demo one.

32
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:46,080
I need to do git commit
minus m. Let's change again.

33
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:56,210
You can also use git commit hyphen
am. So this will add as well as commit.

34
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,810
So this is a shortcut, but it only
works if you are modifying a file.

35
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:03,979
If you have created a new
file, then it will not work.

36
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,560
So you will need to run
add commands separately.

37
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:14,080
But since here we are modifying an
existing file, so we can do git commit minus am.

38
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:24,780
Let's create a, Third commit as
well, so am restore demo three.

39
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:33,419
Now I want to go back to
the third last commit.

40
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,500
Let's say here, restore demo one,

41
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,719
so I want this file to be same as it
was in this commit, third last commit.

42
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:53,050
So I will just copy this hash and
say, Git restore, hyphen hyphen source,

43
00:03:53,050 --> 00:04:00,860
this commit ID, and the name of the file.

44
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,780
Now you can see it's
restored to the third last commit.

45
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:17,550
Instead of copying the hash,
you can also use the head.

46
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:23,509
So we want to go to the third
last commit. So we can say here,

47
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:27,420
instead of commit hash,
go back three commits.

48
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,779
Let's first restore it back.

49
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,879
And now do git restore
source head 3 and file 1.txt.

50
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:44,889
Okay, we have moved further.

51
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:49,519
So we want to go two commits.

52
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:55,250
We want to go to this restore
demo one, which means from the head,

53
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,699
we want to go two commits before.

54
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,449
So I need to write here
two instead of three.

55
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,410
Okay, now it's restored to demo one.

56
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,540
So this is how you can
use the git restore command

57
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,439
in restoring the commits,
actually to any commit.

58
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,519
We can also use git
restore to unstage the changes.

59
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:28,870
So let's make two changes in the file one.

60
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:34,529
Let's change it to
unstaged, similarly unstaged.

61
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:40,019
And now I will add these
two files to my staging area.

62
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:44,339
Let's check using git status command,

63
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:47,790
and it says that you have
modified these two files,

64
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,240
and they have also been
added to the staging area.

65
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,050
Now, in order to unstage these files,

66
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:04,160
I can use git restore hyphen
hyphen staged dot, Using dot,

67
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,050
it will unstage all the files.

68
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:13,060
If you want to unstage a particular file,
then you need to specify the file name,

69
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,500
and this will only unstage file1.txt.

70
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:23,529
So now if I run git status, you can
see I have one file in the staging area,

71
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:25,579
and file1.txt has been unstaged.

72
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,949
Now, it's easy to do this using BS code.

73
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:34,370
So if you want to just add
your files to staging area,

74
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:39,029
you can go to the source control
tab again and just click on plus.

75
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:42,000
It will add the files to the staging area.

76
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,550
And similarly, you can click
on minus, unstage changes,

77
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,720
and this will move them
back to the unstaged area.

78
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,040
You can also stage and
unstage all the files.

79
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,500
With the plus icon in front of the
changes, you can stage all of them together.

80
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,949
And to unstage, you can use
minus with unstage all changes.

81
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,329
And this will be bringing all
your files back to the unstage area.

82
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:18,279
So just feel free to use git restore
command or use VS Code to do the same.
