1
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,679
Let's recap what we
learned in this lesson.

2
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:11,339
So we learned how to
create perfect commits.

3
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:15,320
We saw the first rule is
to create granular commits,

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,460
and the second is to write
commit messages properly.

5
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,890
We talked about conventional commits,

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,629
how we can write better commit
messages using conventional commits.

7
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:30,890
We also talked about amending commits.
We saw that we can amend commit message,

8
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,710
and also we can add files
into the same commit if we have

9
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,049
forgotten to add any file
in a particular commit.

10
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:44,880
Then we also talked about git diff
command, that with git diff command,

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,030
we can compare our
changes with the latest commit,

12
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,530
but also we can use
the git diff command to

13
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,979
compare our current
changes with any commit.

14
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,159
Coming to the exercise,
I want you to practice

15
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,240
making commit and not
just making a commit,

16
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,079
but also trying to write commit
messages using conventional commits.

17
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,230
So practice with conventional commits,

18
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,450
practice different types
of conventional commits.

19
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,670
Second thing I want you to try is amend a
commit using conventional commit message.

20
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:20,769
Change the commit message.

21
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,060
And third, I want you to create a new
file and add it to the same commit.
