1
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:09,470
We have already seen these
commands in the previous section,

2
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:13,630
but let's dive deeper into
it. So what is git pull doing?

3
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:18,059
So whenever we want to
integrate remote repository

4
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:21,879
changes to the working
directory, we use git pull.

5
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,739
Just to recap, your working
directory is where you are making changes.

6
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:30,359
So this is your coding
editor. This is your VS code.

7
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,020
Now on the GitHub repository,

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:38,000
if there are more changes and you want
to integrate it to your local computer,

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,310
then you will do Git pull and it will
bring the changes to your working directory.

10
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:45,950
Another command is git fetch.

11
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:53,399
What git fetch does is that it only
copies the .git folder to your local repository,

12
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,750
which means that now git
knows that there are changes,

13
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,100
but the changes are not made
to your working directory.

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,189
It doesn't come into your VS code.

15
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,849
So git fetch will download the
changes from GitHub remote repository,

16
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:15,129
but you will not see those
changes in your working directory.

17
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:19,040
Fetch will allow you to
review the changes before

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,569
you actually merge it in
your working directory.

19
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,099
Let's practice git fetch and git pull.

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,040
Let's go to our git
video course repository.

21
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:33,459
CD, git.

22
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:40,519
CD get video course.

23
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:52,629
Let's open it in our editor and
let's change some text in the file one.

24
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:57,950
These are my changes for
get fetch and get pull.

25
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:02,489
Let's delete some files this time.

26
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,469
Yeah, I think one and two would be
good. Let's delete file three as well.

27
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:13,699
So practice git pull and git fetch.

28
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:35,879
Yeah, let's git add, and then git
commit, fetch and pull demo, and let's push.

29
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:44,699
In this repository git video course,

30
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:48,210
let's make some changes
directly into this repo.

31
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:56,569
So let's say, let's add a
file. Let's refresh, yeah.

32
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:05,219
So now we don't have file
three and file four, but let's,

33
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:10,250
let's make the changes in file one.

34
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,349
Added from remote.

35
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,069
So let's commit this.

36
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:26,889
I updated file1.ext.

37
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:32,409
Now if I do git pull, so
right now in the file1,

38
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:36,300
I have these other changes
for git fetch and git pull.

39
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,659
But now if I do git pull, it
will change the text of file1.

40
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,129
And because it merged the
changes from the remote to the local.

41
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:51,349
Now let's see what
happens when we do git fetch.

42
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:54,680
Let's make another commit.

43
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:57,840
Let's change file to text this time.

44
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,460
Remote changed file to text.

45
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,020
Let's commit the changes.

46
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:17,889
And this time, I'm going to do
git fetch instead of git pull.

47
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:20,589
I'll git fetch.

48
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:29,040
So git fetch brought the changes, but
the text of file two, it's still the same.

49
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,800
Practice git pull and git fetch.

50
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,259
So what...

51
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,009
From if I do git status, it tells me
that you are behind because there is one

52
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:45,110
change which is in the remote, but
it is not in your working directory.

53
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,500
So what git fetch did was
that it copied the .git folder

54
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,310
so that my git is aware
that there are changes,

55
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,120
but the changes are not
merged in my working directory.

56
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,889
What is the benefit of git
fetch is that sometimes you want to

57
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:08,389
review what changes are there
before you want to merge it.

58
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,959
Basically you want to know
what were the changes, right?

59
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,939
So what we can do is
we can check git diff.

60
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:20,379
Main and origin main.

61
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:25,100
Origin main is your
remote repository main branch.

62
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,250
And this is my local branch.

63
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,379
So I want to know what
is the difference between

64
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:32,410
the main and the remote main branch.

65
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,949
So now it says that file
to text has been changed.

66
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,000
So From the remote, it's
remote change the file to text,

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,019
but you have practice
get pull and get fetch.

68
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,610
So with the green, it tells you
that which are the incoming changes,

69
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,990
like which are the changes
that were coming from the remote.

70
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:01,050
And the red ones are the changes which
you have made in your local repository,

71
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,350
like which are the changes which
currently exist in your local repository.

72
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:09,699
So these are the new changes
which are added into the remote.

73
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:15,750
Now, if you are okay with these
changes and you want to include it,

74
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,670
so you can do git merge, and
you will have the changes here.

75
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:23,730
Sorry, file to remote
change, file to text.

76
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,000
So that is the basic difference
between git pull and git fetch.

77
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,180
Git pull will pull the changes
directly to your working directory.

78
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:39,509
Git fetch will only copy the .git
folder, and once you hit git merge,

79
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:43,970
then you will be seeing those
changes in your local repository.
