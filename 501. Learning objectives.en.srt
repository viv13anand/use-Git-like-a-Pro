Welcome to lesson five,
Discovering Branches and Tags.

2
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:13,150
In this lesson, we'll
dive into branches and tags,

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,210
two powerful tools in
Git that help you organize

4
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,250
and manage your work more effectively.

5
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:22,940
These features are essential for
tracking different lines of development

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,019
and marking important
points in your project history.

7
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,690
We'll start by understanding what
branches are and how they work,

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:35,859
followed by a quick overview of the
concept of head and its role in Git.

9
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:39,740
Next, we'll explore the
essential Git commands.

10
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:43,079
We'll also take a look at
common branching strategies

11
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,090
to help you make the
most out of your workflow.

12
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,159
After that, we'll shift our focus to tags,

13
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:52,520
learning how to use tags for
marking releases in your project.

14
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:55,420
We'll wrap up with
summing up everything we

15
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,670
have learned in this
lesson and an exercise.

16
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,960
That's our journey for
this lesson. Let's jump in.
