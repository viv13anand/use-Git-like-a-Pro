1
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:10,800
So we already talked about
conventional commits. Let's see what they are.

2
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,289
Conventional commits
specification provides an easy

3
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:18,320
set of rules for writing
commit messages properly.

4
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:22,710
So what it says is that if you
have to write a commit message,

5
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,579
you will define what is the
type of the commit message.

6
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,929
Then you will define the
scope and description.

7
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:34,609
You also can define
optional body and footer.

8
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:41,850
So if you're using conventional
commit, the type is the type of commit.

9
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:47,179
So there are four or five types
which you can use. Like, for example,

10
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:49,570
for a bug fix, it can be a fix.

11
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,270
For a feature, the type can be feet.

12
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,460
There are other types, like core,

13
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,469
if you are updating any
library or there is some cleanup.

14
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,489
Then you have refactor, if
there are any refactors.

15
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,530
For the test, you can mention it as test.

16
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:12,640
For the CSS or any other style
changes, you can mention it as styles.

17
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:15,980
For the documents, you can specify docs.

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,159
So this clearly tells that what
is the type of commit message.

19
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:26,750
In order to highlight some commits
that there can be some commits which

20
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,780
are really important or which
you want to pay more attention to.

21
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,560
So you can use exclamation sign,

22
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,790
which tells that this is a breaking
change and it needs more attention.

23
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,629
So these are just some
types which you can use.

24
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:48,290
Fix, colon, resolve issue with user
registration, then feature, feat, colon,

25
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:53,219
add user authentication feature.
For refactor, you have refactor,

26
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:57,519
extract validation, for core,
core, clean up unused dependencies.

27
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:01,680
So these are some of the
examples how your commit messages

28
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,340
will look if you are
using conventional commits.

29
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:09,830
Next we also talked about was scope.
What is a scope in conventional commit?

30
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:16,229
So you basically define a
scope in your parenthesis.

31
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,370
So this tells that what
this feature is about.

32
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,870
For example, in this
case, it's like language,

33
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,990
and I've specified this
feature is related to language.

34
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,050
So it says add Polish language.

35
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:37,360
But let's say you are working on,
again, like authentication or user login.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,009
So your feature can be
related to user login.

37
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:47,889
So in that case, all the commits
which are related to user login,

38
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:50,060
you can specify feed user login.

39
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:56,099
Often what we also do is that we, in
the scope, we specify the epic name.

40
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:01,789
So if you're working with Jira, you are
familiar with epics, then in the epic,

41
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:07,349
we usually specify the epic. Like,
for example, if this is related to...

42
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:13,680
Reporting. So I would add like
feature reporting and the message.

43
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,000
So this gives a very good idea
about what this feature is about.

44
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:23,509
And if you are looking for a particular
commit, it's easy to find in the history.

45
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,539
For drawing the attention,

46
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:32,500
how you would use exclamation sign is
along with the type. So like feature,

47
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,400
exclamation, and then you
provide your commit message.

48
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,590
You can also specify with
breaking change text and colon

49
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,340
and add what is the
breaking change in this commit.

50
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,729
So basically you specify that
this is an important commit,

51
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:49,840
but why this is important
because this has this breaking change.

52
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,030
There are also commit
messages with body and footer,

53
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,590
and you will see it a lot many
times in the design system repos.

54
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:07,919
So in design systems, they usually
add a lot of, in a single commit,

55
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,439
they add a lot of body,
what are the changes in

56
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:15,310
that particular commit,
and also the footers.

57
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,240
So how this looks is that you...

58
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:23,519
Add a proper description, but then you
add more what are the changes. For example,

59
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,180
if you are building a model component,

60
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,990
then you would add like
what all changes it has

61
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,649
related to model,
dialogues, all those things.

62
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:37,709
And then in the footer, you can
specify like co-authored by this person,

63
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:42,240
this closes this, this resolve this
issue number, so you can specify that.

64
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:46,250
One thing to note here
is that when you are

65
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,240
drafting commit
messages, use present tense.

66
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,899
For example, if you are
implementing user authentication,

67
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:58,949
your conventional commit
message should be like implement user

68
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:02,310
authentication and not
implemented user authentication.

69
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,839
I've also specified a link
of conventional commits,

70
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:10,569
so there are more rules
which you can Look into,

71
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:15,560
there are extended more things you
can do with it. It's a really nice way.

72
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,459
And if you are not using
it in your company project,

73
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:23,579
it's a very good way to
introduce it as it helps a lot.

74
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,759
Then you are reviewing the comments.

75
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:31,269
Let's go back to our
Git video course repo.

76
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,769
Here, let's create a new
file. Let's say login.js.

77
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:50,120
So I will just create a
function, console.log.

78
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,620
Let's say I also create a login.html.

79
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,129
Let's say login screen.

80
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:11,160
So now I want to, so these two
files are related to my login feature.

81
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,560
So when I commit, I can do is git add all,

82
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,569
but I will also do is git commit
minus m, and how I will specify this,

83
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:30,579
because this is a feature, so I will
do feed, and I will add the scope,

84
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:33,649
which is this feature, this is login,

85
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:45,269
And then I will specify
or implement user login.

86
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,670
Implement user login.

87
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:56,949
Sometimes what we also do is that we
specify the task ID or the Jira ID, like T123.

88
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:02,240
So this is also really helpful.

89
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,120
If you want to go back to the
task and see what the task is,

90
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,519
you specify in your commit message.

91
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:11,889
So now you can commit it
with the proper commit message.

92
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:18,129
In case there was a bug, I wanted to
fix it. So let's say I fix the bug.

93
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:24,470
Now if I make any change,
and I want to make a commit,

94
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,980
I will do git commit minus
m, and instead of now feed,

95
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,110
because this is a bug
fix, so I will do fix.

96
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:36,910
I will also provide the
scope, what this fix is about.

97
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:43,579
Sorry, which feature this fix is
for. So it's for the login feature,

98
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:47,420
and here I will add fix user login.

99
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:56,180
There are also conventions
about the casing. In some projects,

100
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:02,490
I have seen that using always small
case, but there's no hard and fast rule.

101
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:09,269
You can check more in the conventional
commits, and here you specify the ID.

102
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,269
So this was everything
about conventional commits,

103
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:18,300
how to write proper commit messages.
