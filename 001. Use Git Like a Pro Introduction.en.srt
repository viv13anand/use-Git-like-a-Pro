16
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:08,120
Whether you are new to version control or
looking to enhance your existing skills,

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,209
this course is designed for you.

18
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:15,510
It aims to equip you with practical
knowledge to use Git effectively.

19
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,859
You will also learn to
confidently collaborate

20
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:21,060
with others in your development workflow.

21
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:26,450
The first lesson in this course
provides an overview of version control.

22
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:31,500
In this module, you gain a solid
understanding of Git and GitHub,

23
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,719
two widely used tools in the
software development world.

24
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,819
We cover the key Git terminologies,

25
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:41,739
learn how to set up and
install Git on your system,

26
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:46,010
and explore how to push code to
a remote repository on GitHub.

27
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:51,099
By the end of this lesson, you
should be able to create, clone,

28
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:52,650
and manage repositories with ease.

29
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:59,409
In the second lesson, we dive
deeper into the practical use of Git,

30
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:01,400
focusing on its workflow and commands.

31
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,989
The goal is to learn how to use Git,

32
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:08,419
both from the command line and
through the graphical user interface.

33
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,110
We explore how to add and
commit changes to a Git repository.

34
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,389
You are introduced to the Git log command,

35
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:18,710
which helps in
reviewing the previous commits.

36
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:24,090
This module covers how to fetch and
pull updates from a remote repository.

37
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,449
Additionally, we simplify
your workflow with Git aliases,

38
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:32,419
which help you create shortcuts
for frequently used commands.

39
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:39,110
Next lesson covers how to create
perfect commits and write clear

40
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,199
commit messages using the
conventional commits format,

41
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:44,400
ensuring a clean project history.

42
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,599
You will learn how to
amend commits and use the

43
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,930
git diff command to
review changes effectively.

44
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,669
After that, we move on to see how to undo
changes in Git commands like git checkout,

45
00:02:57,669 --> 00:03:00,050
git restore, git reset, and git revert.

46
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:04,979
We are going to learn when and
how to use each of these commands

47
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:07,680
to revert and modify
changes safely in your project.

48
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,319
By the end, you should know how to
effectively recover from the mistakes.

49
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,879
Next, we will explore git branches,

50
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:21,229
understanding how they work and how to
manage them with commands like git branch.

51
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:25,379
We will also learn how to
rename and delete branches.

52
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,259
This lesson also covers usage of
tags for versioning and releases,

53
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:34,379
providing tools for more
organized project management.

54
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,389
Finally, we move to the most
important part of our day-to-day workflow.

55
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,129
We dive into merging and rebasing.

56
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,639
You are going to learn
the differences between

57
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,789
these two methods of integrating changes,

58
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:51,020
practice them, and discover
how to create pull requests.

59
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:57,819
And finally, we close the course with
some advanced Git concepts like stashing,

60
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:00,409
squashing commits,
performing an interactive rebase,

61
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:03,430
and using reflog to correct our mistakes.

62
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,849
Well, that's the basic plan of the course.

63
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,000
Thanks again for joining me in this live
lessons, and I hope you enjoy the course.
